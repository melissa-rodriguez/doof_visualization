Linda," Phineas? Ferb? Hey, boys. So, what's on the agenda for today?"
Phineas, We though we'd do something classic and take Perry for a walk in the park.
Linda," He does need the exercise. Well, I'm heading to the store to pick up some things for dinner. I'm thinking spaghetti and meatballs, or a spaghetti-meatball. That's spaghetti and meat mixed up into a big ball. It's less of a choice of foodm than a choice of shape. Don't forget to bring a doodie bag for Perry! (leaves)"
Phineas," We won't! (to Ferb) Hey, where is Perry?"
Phineas," You know, Ferb, we should build a Perry. For occasions like this, when we're Perry-less. A giant anamatronic Perry with flashing eyes, fiberglass bill and... (Ferb holds up a blueprint of the Perrytronic 3000) Judo flipping tail action? Ferb, you anticipate my every need."
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P, and welcome to our new Evil Science Readiness Program. You just keep circling Doof's building, and the second Doofenshmirtz is ready to begin his scheme, you'll be there. It doesn't leave a lot of time for friends and family, (Perry looks a bit sad) but -- we feel the dramatic decrease in response time could well be worth it."
Doofenshmirtz," What is he doing up there, just flying around in circles, uhh. It gives me the creeps! Well, it worked out in my favor anyway because, turn, close latch, I'm finally ready to begin my scheme!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ha! You want to be a bird? Is that what you want? Well, this is what we do with birds, we put them in a cage. Can you speak, little birdy? Hello? Say, ""Hello, Perry want a cracker."" (Perry bites his finger) Ow! Bad bird! That would not have happened to me if I was smarter, which brings me to my new inator. The Duplicator-inator 2! You know what they say about two heads are better than one, right? Well, I will duplicate my head, and become twice as smart! And look, I even did some recycling by using my old microwave oven. (opens door) Baked potato? Eh, maybe later. (closes door) All my life I've been a zero, but when I have two heads, I'm gonna be twice that! You'll see!"
Phineas," Too steely-eyed, Isabella! Less focus!"
Isabella, Whoops! (separates the eyes) How's this?
Phineas, Perfect!
Buford," (oiling the feet) Sure, you get the fun part. If I wanted to oil feet, I could've stayed at home."
Baljeet," (peeks out of the belly) When we are done with this, what will it do?"
Phineas," Unlike a real platypus, which doesn't do much, the Perrytronic 3000's capabilities will be limitless!"
Candace," KEEP IT UP! DON'T STOP, BUSY BEES! YOU'RE BUSY, BUSY, BEES!"
Stacy, What are you doing?
Candace, WORK! WORK! WORK! WORK!
Stacy," All right, I'm out of here. You lost it. (starts to leave)"
Candace," No, wait! (brings Stacy back) Okay? There is a madness to my method."
Stacy, You've got three seconds.
Candace," Everything Phineas and Ferb build -- disappears when they're finished. So if I can keep them from finishing the thing they're building, it will never disappear! I call it Busy Bee Busting. B. B. Busting, for short."
Stacy," You know what? I'll see you, La-La-Later. (leaves)"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, let's try this. (fires the inator at his head and laughs) At last, I am --"
Doofenshmirtz head," Don't just stand there, pick me up!"
Both," Well, hello, handsome!"
Phineas, Looks like we're done!
Candace," What? No! What are you talking about, ""done""?"
Phineas," Well, the tail glaze is almost cool, so we just figured we'd test her out and then close the book on this one."
Candace," Test, yes. Close book, no!"
Phineas," Okay, I guess we could consider this a sort of preliminary test before the real test."
Candace," Sh'ya! Now preliminary test his heap, and back to work. And what is this thing, anyway?"
Phineas, Don't worry! The theme song will explain everything!
Candace, Theme song?
Phineas, It tested perfect! Looks like we're are done!
Candace," Oh, no, you're not! Can it bake a pie? Can it train a seal? Can it give change?"
Phineas," Wow. She's right, guys. We're not nearly done!"
Candace," All right, you busy bees, you're back on the clock! (whispering) B. B. Busting. (normal, on phone) Hello, Mom?"
Linda," Yes, Candace? I just checked out, I'm on my way home, now! (doesn't notice her purse left on the counter)"
Doofenshmirtz," I don't understand, I really thought two heads were better than one, you know, for the thinking. But I can't think of anything!"
Both," Maybe we need a break. We keep doing that! I know, it's so funny! Ahhh! we did it again! And again!"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, knock it off. Let's play with our inator for a while!"
Doofenshmirtz head," (chuckles) Now, this is fun!"
Doofenshmirtz," I know, right? (laughs)"
Doofenshmirtz head," Look! Two more heads. Ha ha! Look at Perry and his little arms, aren't they adorable?"
Doofenshmirtz," You're right, let's make more."
Doofenshmirtz head," Oh, look! A little arm that can move around on its own, (the arm frees Perry) It's got its own volition. I did not expect that. Wait, you dummkopf! Look what you've done! (the arm attacks him)"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, who's the Dummkopf now, Dummkopf?"
Doofenshmirtz head, Hit him! Hit him!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, good idea! (repeatedly fires the ray at Perry, cloning his arms)"
Doofenshmirtz head," Not with the ray, you nincompoop! Oh, point that somewhere else!"
Doofenshmirtz, (turns the inator around) Like this? (repeatedly fires ray) How is this helping? I don't understand your logic.
Candace, Mom? Where are you now?
Linda, I just pulled up the driveway.
Candace," You guys are still working, right?"
Phineas, Just taking a break before we install the chicken incubator.
Candace," Mom, look in the backyard, now!"
Linda," Hang on, let me put the groceries away."
Candace, Ee-ee-ee-ee... (at the kids) Don't. Stop. Working.
Candace,"Mom!...Mom, you're not in the kitchen?"
Linda," No, I'm just shutting the front door!"
Candace, I need you in the kitchen. Mom?
Linda," In the bathroom, putting away soap!"
Candace," How did I just miss you? Mom? (to Phineas and Ferb) Work, work, work! (to Linda, knocking on door) Mom, come out of the bathroom, quick!"
Linda," Nope, I'm in your room! You said you needed tissues."
Candace," But how did you -- okay, I'm on my way. (goes upstairs, sees the kids) Put that lemonade down! You're not done yet!"
Candace,"What the -- Mom, you're not in my room!"
Linda, I'm back in the kitchen.
Candace, (watching the kids) Okay. Listen very carefully. Look. Out. The window.
Linda," (from the phone) Oh, my goodness!"
Candace, Ee-ee-ee-ee...yeah? Yeah?
Linda, We really need to paint that fence!
Candace, ...What? That's all you have to say?!
Linda," (from the phone) Hang on, Candace. My other line is ringing!"
Candace, How could she not notice that?
Linda," (from the phone) Candace, that was the supermarket. I left my pocketbook there. I'm gonna run over and pick it up."
Candace," Mom, no! (runs out, but is too late) Mom! Oh, no, I'm too...too...two houses?!?"
Candace,"Okay, I did not see that coming. Phineas and Ferb, this has to be their work."
Doofenshmirtz, Uh...distract them for me!
Doofenshmirtz head," Yeah, I'll give them a licking they'll never forget!"
Doofenshmirtz, Good one!
Doofenshmirtz head," Thanks! (a few of the arms tickle him, he laughs) That tickles! Quit it! (grunts)"
Doofenshmirtz," (runs up to the inator but the arms pull him back) Noooooooo! Oh, you guys are so annoying. You're kinda cute, though. (two of the arms punch him) Get off!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Tails? What are they gonna do, wag me into submission? Well, you're too late, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Heads, I win, tails, you lose!"
Doofenshmirtz head 2, Really? That's the best you got?
Doofenshmirtz head 6, Kinda obvious.
Doofenshmirtz head 7, Juvenile.
Doofenshmirtz head 4, I liked it.
"Doofenshmirtz heads 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7", You would!
Doofenshmirtz," You know, you guys are kind of annoying, too. GET HIM! (tosses heads at Perry)"
Doofenshmirtz head 2, You guys get phantom pains? I got a heck of one in my elbow right now.
Doofenshmirtz, Ha ha!
"What? It just -- vanished? What's wrong with this thing? (looks at the microwave timer, it says ""3","00"") Oh, the microwave was on the ""baked potato"" setting, so I guess everything is just gonna last for three minutes. My bad!"
Candace," Mom, Mom! Mom, get ready to have your eyes opened wide!"
Linda," Just a sec, hon."
Candace, (turns around and gestures toward second house with eyes closed) Look!
Candace, But...but but but but but...
Linda," Oh, when are they ever going to build something in that empty lot? (leaves)"
Candace," Wait! I don't have to ""but, but, but"". I have the Perrytronic 3000! (runs off) Mom?!"
Doofenshmirtz," (grunts) Ooh, I hate you, you little green -- (the arms punch him and disappear, he punches himself) Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't have to do this anymore. (at Perry) Well, we still have you surrounded, Perry the Platypus."
Doofenshmirtz head 2," Hey, that disappearing thing's not gonna happen to us, is it?"
Doofenshmirtz head 5," Yeah, a microwave timer. Great idea. (disappears)"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, that's unfortunate."
Doofenshmirtz head, You're telling me?
Linda," ""Step 4: Insert spaghetti into meat""."
Candace," (barges in from backyard) Mom, Mom, Mom! This time it's for keeps. Turn around, and look in the yard."
Linda, But I have to inject the cheese. Just let me finish.
Candace," No, I can't let you finish! They might be finished!"
Linda," OH! I'll just order a pizza! All right, Candace, let's see what you've got..."
Doofenshmirtz head," Not the golf clubs, NOT THE GOLF CLUBS! (screams) SAVE ME!"
Doofenshmirtz," There's a pun here, I know it."
Doofenshmirtz head, (continues screaming)
Doofenshmirtz, He looks teed off! That's what it was! (turns around) Huh?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, no! My inator!"
Doofenshmirtz head, We've got to do something.
Doofenshmirtz, You're right. (throws the head) Go get him.
Doofenshmirtz head, Ouch! Ouch! Ow! Ow! Oh! Why couldn't I have disappeared before I hit the ground? Curse -- (disappears)
Doofenshmirtz," What? Now, I'll never know what he was going to say! (the inator explodes, Perry flies away) Oh, yeah, yeah, that."
Candace, Ee-ee-ee-ee...
Linda," Hello, Perry. (to Candace) Okay, that was a nice change of pace. (to the kids) Who wants pizza?"
Phineas/Buford/Isabella, Me!
Baljeet, I do!
Linda," Then, maybe ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cut in the shape of a sandwich."
Ferb," Just pie for me, please."
Candace," Okay, now I have to ""but, but, but""."
