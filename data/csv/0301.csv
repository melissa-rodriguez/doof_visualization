Phineas," (offscreen) Hey, Ferb. What'cha wanna do today?"
Phineas," (offscreen) Oops! (his hand comes in to pick it up.) It's way to nice out to be lying down. (Zoom out; they are in the living room, it is raining outside.) At least...in here, it is."
Phineas, Come in!
Isabella, (Sad voice) Hey Phineas. What'cha doin'?
Phineas," Oh, what's the matter?"
Isabella," (Sighs) We were going to go for our desert trekking patch today, but now it's raining."
Phineas," Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Candace," You see, I know Jeremy likes me, but I don't know why he likes me. And if I find out what it is that he likes about me, I can make sure I don't change that about myself. Because what if I stop doing whatever he likes? And then he stops liking me because I'm not doing it anymore?"
Linda," Well, maybe he just likes hearing you talk."
Candace, Huh?
Linda," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram, It's not like Agent P to miss...
Major Monogram,"Carl, play that back!"
Carl," Right away, sir! (Presses play on the remote control and Perry slides on the video)"
Major Monogram, (Laughs)
Carl," (Presses the slow motion button and Perry is in slow motion) Look sir, it's even funnier this way!"
Major Monogram," (Laughs) Stop it, stop it. My cheeks hurt."
Major Monogram," Oh uh... (Clears throat) Grow up, Carl!"
Major Monogram," Anyhow, as you probably noticed there's been an unusual amount of rain in the Tri-State Area. Call us crazy, but we're thinking Doofenshmirtz! Investigate, and stop him at all costs. Well, maybe at a reasonable cost. We, I mean, we don't want to blow the whole budget on this one scheme, do we?"
Carl," Run it again, sir?"
Major Monogram, I'll get the popcorn!
Isabella," Wow, that was fast!"
Phineas," Well, nobody likes working in the rain. Let's get dry, ladies! (As Phineas, Ferb, and the Fireside Girls enter the bio-dome) This biosphere can simulate almost any environment. (Ferb pulls a lever, sand begins pouring out of the ceiling, a fake sun shines and the tiles on the inside of the biosphere turn sky blue.) Can we cook or can't we?"
Isabella," You guys are the greatest! Okay, according to the Fireside Girl handbook, we can find water in cacti."
Isabella,"Now, don't make it too easy!"
Jeremy," Hi, Candace. What do you say to a little picnic? You know, indoors."
Candace, Neat!
Jeremy," We can't let a little rain put a damper on our-- wow! (Sees the biosphere, and Candace panics) I guess your brothers have been busy, huh? Oh, we should have our picnic in there!"
Candace," Um, um... Excuse me! (Walks away from Jeremy to resolve her inner turmoil) Urge to bust so strong, but I need time with Jeremy to find out why he likes me! Gotta resist urge to bust! Must not spoil quality time with boyfriend! (Composes herself and returns to his side) Uh, picnic in the dangerous, unauthorized, and highly bust-worthy biosphere? Sounds great! (Giggles insincerely)"
Isabella," So, we've gotten water from a cactus, witnessed a mirage, and learned the difference between sunstroke and heatstroke. Thanks for that, Adyson."
Adyson, Hey... the salamanders quit singing... (Giggles)
Isabella," Now we just need to either collect a sand sample, measure the temperature, or milk a camel."
Isabella, You guys!
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, I set up this whole thing with lasers and flypaper, falling cages, spinning platforms, on the way to a trapdoor... (The camera pans across this devious contraption) And you just come and slip on a chair, and waste a day's worth of work. Eh. (As Perry emerges from the hole in the ground in a green glass tube) But it's gonna look great on the Christmas party gag reel, hehehe! Of course, it'll just be me at the party, uh...yeah. (Sighs) I need a laugh at the holidays. Anyway, gotcha! Go ahead, try to climb out of it."
Doofenshmirtz," (Laughs) It's greased! So, now that you're all comfy cozy I can introduce you to my Rain-inator! I've been using it to pour millions of gallons of water into these clouds, causing it to rain all over the Tri-State Area! I can't believe nobody's noticed it. It's kind of obvious."
Isabella," Yay! We made it across the desert! Say, Phineas, I don't suppose you could help us out with our Rainforest Navigation Patch?"
Phineas," No problem, ladies. Ferb?"
Jeremy," Well, this sure beats all that rain. Not too hot, are you?"
Candace," No, no, not at all! I mean, isn't that what you said you liked about me? That I don't ""overheat""?"
Jeremy," Heh, no. The thing I really like about you is..."
Jeremy," Wow, this is incredible!"
Candace," Um, uh, what was that you were saying?"
Jeremy," I said, This is incredible!"
Candace," No, before that."
Jeremy, I said...wow!
Candace, (In a shallow state of calm) Pardon.
Jeremy, Sure. Hmm...
Adyson, Hey! I think I found a new species of -
Isabella," Here, Adyson! Catch this! (Throws the lasso) Swift Water Rescue Patch! Bonus!"
Jeremy, Candace!
Candace, Yes?
Jeremy, Check it out. This umbrella makes a sweet raft. Wanna float down the river with me?
Candace, (still fighting between her two halves) Busting. Boyfriend. Busting. Boyfriend. Busting? Boyfriend! (Giggles) Coming!!!
Doofenshmirtz," So, I bet you're wondering why did I cause all this rain. You see, while perusing local garage sales, I came upon a big screen TV from 1985. (Removes the tarp covering it) But when I went to turn it on, it was stuck on the Spanish channel!"
Doofenshmirtz," All it played was crazy variety shows and Mexican soap operas. (Turns on the TV) I really got hooked on one of them, though: El Matador de Amor. (Sets up his armchair to watch the soap opera.) It has three simultaneous story lines that interconnect... Genius! Anyway, the last episode was a cliffhanger..."
Doofenshmirtz," ...in which Esmerelda is going to find out why Juan loves her. At least, I think that's what's going to happen... But the show got preempted by a soccer game! Oh, I hate soccer! It makes no sense whatsoever! The clock runs up instead of counting down, what is that?! (Removes popcorn from the microwave and sits down in his armchair.) So with the help of my Rain-inator I rained the game out."
Doofenshmirtz," And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming."
Spanish Man on TV, ¡La Esponja Milagroso! Absorbes... (continues under)
Doofenshmirtz," In 10 minutes, the show is gonna start, and with you trapped and the Rain-inator at work, nothing will interrupt me!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, less pounding back there, okay? You're lucky I sprang for the clear tube, this way, you can watch too!"
Jeremy," I mean, it's like your hair was genetically engineered to ensnare those giant fruit bats."
Candace, And you like that about me?
Jeremy," It's certainly interesting, but...it's not what I like about you."
Candace, What then?
Jeremy," Well, let me put it in a song."
Jeremy, ♪ All throughout history men fall in love with women ♪
Candace," So, you were saying?"
Jeremy," Oh, yeah."
Jeremy," Hey, guys! Uh-oh, here comes the fun part!"
Candace, Fun part?! Seriously?!
Isabella, Jungle Navigation Patch: complete! Anybody up for a little rock-climbing?
Phineas, Behold Mount Ferbius!
Ferb," Sorry, Adyson."
Adyson, The salamanders are back...
Isabella, Who wants a Concussion First Aid Patch?
Candace, Incoming!!!
Jeremy," (As he moves his arms and legs back and forth) Ha, hey, look, Candace, I'm making snow angels."
Candace, (Grumpily) I'm wet and I'm freezing cold.
Jeremy," Ah, it's not so bad. I mean, we're together, aren't we?"
Candace," Well, yeah..."
Jeremy, And being together like this makes me realize what I like about you.
Candace, (Excitedly) What? What???
Jeremy, What's that sound?
Candace, That could've squished us! That's it! I am gonna bust them!
Jeremy," (As Candace stomps away angrily) Wait, Candace, look! It's just papier-mâché! (Lifts the boulder easily)"
Isabella," Good job, everyone. I think we've earned our Rock Climbing Patches."
Phineas," (In a hang-glider) Congratulations, ladies. How do you feel about Non-Powered Flight Patches?"
Candace," Hey, come back here! I'm gonna bust you two if it's the last thing I--"
Spanish Man on TV, El Matador de Amor.
Doofenshmirtz," (As sappy guitar music plays in the background) It's starting! It's starting!!! Okay, now, Perry the Platypus, shhh."
Doofenshmirtz,I don't want to miss anything.
Esmerelda," Oh, Juan..."
Juan," Por lo Tanto su manada gemela, ha sido en Venenado..."
Candace, (Screams) Help me!
Jeremy," Hold on, Candace, I'll save you!"
Jeremy,"I gotcha, Candace!"
Jeremy," Oh, man, I love this umbrella!"
Linda," Hey, kids!"
Jeremy," You know, Candace, what I was trying to say back there is that...well, the thing I like about you is..."
Candace, Wait! Hold that thought! I'll be right back. (She runs over to Linda in her usual fashion.) Mom! Mom! Backyard! Now! Biosphere!
Doofenshmirtz, (from inside) He's getting closer...he's looking into her eyes!
Doofenshmirtz,He's opening his mouth!
Doofenshmirtz,"He's forming his lips to start to articulate the syllables! Tell her, Juan! Tell her why you love her!!!"
Juan, Es! La razón porque te amo (Repeat) La razón porque te amos es... es...
Juan,Es!
Sport Announcer, ¡Ahi Van la Pelota!
Doofenshmirtz, What?! No!!!!!
Candace," It's right here, Mom! Come on, come on, come on!"
Phineas/Fireside Girls," Hi, Candace!"
Linda," (enters) Hmm, I've really got to fix the latch on that gate. (Both turn around and see the empty backyard.) Um... (Candace facepalms.)"
Doofenshmirtz," How is this possible? I took every precaution! I had the Rain-inator, I had you trapped in a - what the?"
Doofenshmirtz," ¡Maldito seas, Perry el Ornitorrinco! Man, this is gonna cost me a fortune on my water bill."
Linda," So, did you ever find out why Jeremy likes you?"
Candace," Jeremy! (She bolts over to him.) Now, please continue your thought. Tell me why you like me."
Jeremy, You bet. The reason that I like you is...
Sport Announcer," ¡Viene, le pega! ¡GOOOOOOOL!"
