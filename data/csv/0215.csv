Candace," Oh, my gosh, Stacy, have you heard? ""About what""? About Jeremy, he's on a TV commercial."
Stacy," Yeah, I know. I heard it from Christina, who heard it from Jenny, who heard it from Jessie who heard it from you!"
Candace," Well, it's totally true. Do you know what this means?"
Stacy, He's totally out of your league.
Candace, He's totally out of my league! What am I going to do?
Stacy, How should I know? I don’t know anything about celebrity relations.
Candace, That's it! If I can get on TV then Jeremy will see my star quality and we'll be on the same level again!
Stacy, How exactly are you going to do that?
Candace," I guess you're right, getting on TV might be kinda difficult."
Stacy," Yeah, I guess you forgot about that insignificant little detail."
Candace," He, he, insignificant little detail, insignificant little... Phineas and Ferb! Stacy you're a genius."
Stacy, Would you call my mom and tell her that?
Candace, Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and...! (She runs into the sliding door)
Phineas, So you just switch the solenoid here with the ganglion there and...
Candace, Phineas and Ferb.
Isabella," Hey, Candace. What'cha dooooin'?"
Candace, Freaking out. What are you guys doing?
Phineas, We're helping the Fireside Girls.
Isabella," Yeah, we're working on our broadcasting patches."
Phineas, We're gonna to do a game show. Baljeet and Buford are the contestants. We're even gonna broadcast it all over the Tri-State Area.
Candace," Great, I knew I came to the right place. Here's the deal: I'm the star."
Phineas," Well, all right then."
Candace," (At Baljeet and Buford) Okay, one of you get off the stage."
Baljeet, Whoa!
Candace, Right then. Let's get this thing started.
Phineas," (At Ferb) You know, we should give Perry a cameo. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P, uh... ahem. Carl and I made a bet, and, well... I lost. (Clears throat)"
Carl, (In a falsetto voice) Dozens of delivery trucks have been...
Major Monogram," This was, uh, part of the bet."
Carl," ...showing up at Doofenshmirtz's, and no good can come from that. Get to the bottom of it. (Laughs)"
Major Monogram, This actually wasn’t part of the bet.
Baljeet, Do not worry your pretty little head. I have plenty of experience with this sort of thing.
Buford," (picks up Baljeet) You better, man! My face is my fortune!"
Baljeet, Of course it is. (chuckles)
Candace," (on phone) Yeah, Stacy, the boys are putting on a game show! And I'm the star! This'll totally do it!"
Stacy," Well, I hope it does do ""it"", because Jeremy's getting huger by the minute. I know because Megan's blog says she thinks so."
Candace, No way!
Phineas, And how are my favorite contestants today.
Buford," We're your only contestants, dillweed."
Phineas," I just wanted to remind everyone that the physical challenges are a little rigorous, but the rewards are inconsequential. So if things get too rough out there, you can drop out anytime you want."
Candace," Oh, don't worry about me. I can handle anything."
Buford," If the girl's in, I'm in!"
Phineas," Anyway, if you need anything, (snaps fingers) don't bother to speak up."
Candace, I can't believe my own brother doesn't think I can stick it out. I'll show him. I'm star material here! MAKEUP! (Gretchen hits her with a vaudevillian oversized powderpuff) Let's do this thing!
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, how do you like my new Nemesis Catch-o-Mat? I bought it from the TV. (Perry gives him a look)"
Ad Man, Buy now for only $5.99 and get—
Doofenshmirtz, (on phone) I'll take two!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, I see you've taken notice of all the infomercial products. I seem to have developed an addiction to them. I-It started with the Fruit Dehydrator. Here I've been eating hydrated fruit like a sucker my whole life! (doorbell rings) Excuse me, Perry the Platypus."
Delivery Guy, Sign here please.
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, my Serve-O-Mat! See, this is what I'm talking about, I don't even know what a Serve-O-Mat is and now I own five. These infomercials are taking time away from my evil. People ask, ""Doof, if you have unwanted infomercials, how do you get rid of them?"" My solution is easy, simple, and it starts working the same day. With my Scorch-inator, I will target TV towers and melt, smelt, and render them into their basic components, thereby eliminating infomercials! And how much would I pay for this? Nothing, it's free! But wait! There's more! N-Th-There's not really any more, that's about it."
Phineas," Welcome to ♪ Let's Take a Quiz! ♪, where the rules are answer fast and answer often. Let's meet our contestants. (close up on Candace with a neutral expression on her face) She's allergic to parsnips and dairy, say hello to my sister, Candace Flynn!"
Candace," (looks at the camera and then smiles) Oh, uh, (waves) hi!"
Phineas," He's a bully by vocation, but has a soft spot for goldfish. Say hello to Buford van Stomm!"
Phineas (cont'd)," I see we have no clear fan favorite tonight. All right. (zips to the podium on stage) Let's start round one of ♪ Let's Take a Quiz! ♪ This is a high-speed round we call our quizzed-off round. As usual, I start you off. Remember, just go as fast as you can, we'll keep track of the points. Here we go. Prestidigitation!"
Buford, Oh oh oh oh oh! (dings bell) Bunions! (buzz!)
Phineas," Oh, I'm sorry about that. That's gonna be a five-point penalty."
Buford, Aw.
Candace, Wait a minute. Why does he lose fi—
Phineas," I'm sorry, all questions must be phrased in the form of an answer. Okay, we're back in play now, and... Passamaquody."
Buford, (dings) Nonchalant.
Phineas, Form of the word?
Buford," Eh...""chalant""? (bell dings)"
Phineas, Defenestrate.
Buford, Defenestration.
Phineas, Diphthong.
Buford, Linoleum.
Phineas, Ersatz.
Buford, Pencil.
Phineas, Nice job.
Candace, Hello?
Stacy, What's the matter with you?! You're just standing there!
Candace, I don't know what they're talkin' about!
Stacy, You're losing right now and losers don't have star quality! Say something!
Candace, Like what?
Phineas," 45 points for Candace! (crowd cheers) Good one, Candace."
Buford, (growls and dings) Pocket lint!
Candace, (dings) Laminate!
Buford, Dolomite!
Candace, Porpoise!
Buford, Tralfazz!
Candace, Tralfazz??
Buford, That's right! TRALFAZZ!!
Candace, Fine Tralfazz!
Phineas," Ooh, bonus!"
Doofenshmirtz," What's the matter, Perry the Platypus? You don't like my little plan? Think about it this way: Since infomercials are almost universally hated, I will actually be doing a civic good by destroying them! Huh? You see? You like that? W— Oof! (Perry somehow gets out of the Nemesis Catch-o-Mat, and jumps on Doof. Cut to show Perry holding a device) Aha, yes, the E-Z Automatic Trap Escaper. I must've left it out where you could reach it. Well, I was able to reach this! (He reaches offscreen and retrieves a mallet-looking device) It's the Swapotron-Smash-o-Matic! (a boxing glove comes out of the mallet and punches Perry) I got it for only $99.95. (Perry gets another device) Ah, the Labco Pocket Tennis Ball Launcher provides exquisite (gets hit with a tennis ball) Oof!—accuracy. (takes out another device) Face the hideous might of my Burgerizer 2100 hamburger patty air cannon! Eat patty!"
Buford, Bolshevik!
Candace, Knobby.
Phineas, Not quite.
Candace, Scamper!
Buford, Procrastination!
Candace, Scrumptuous!
Buford, Swagger. Tony!
Candace, Tony?
Buford, Y not?
Phineas, Why not?
Buford," Yeah, ""Tony"" backwards!"
Phineas, Judges?
Phineas, 30 points. Physical challenge!
Candace, Whadaya mean physical chall— (A mechanical arm pies Candace in the face. Another pair of mechanical arms puts a bag on her head) This doesn't even make any sense!
Phineas, Wow! A hundred points! Candace is on fire!
Candace," Woohoo. I'm not really on fire, am I?"
Buford," No, you're good."
Doofenshmirtz," Heh-heh! How did I find you? Well, it was easy, with my Platy-Positioner satellite global platypus locator. Patent pending. (Perry kicks him.)"
Buford, Slippery snagglefoot.
Phineas," That answer is correct! Candace, do you want the minus two thousand points or do you want another physical challenge?"
Candace, I'll take another physical challenge.
Audience, She's taking the physical challenge!
Coltrane," Dude, it's so cool you're in this commercial."
Jeremy, Thanks.
Coltrane," Hey, let's see if it's on another channel. Wai-w-w-wait! Is that Candace?"
Jeremy," (offscreen) Woah! (cut back to Jeremy's living room) She's, like, a TV star! (Coltrane nods)"
Doofenshmirtz," Not only will I defeat you with this Flab Crusher, but I'm simultaneously getting a good burn on my delts. $10.99! Hmm? (Perry holds a vacuum-like device and turns it on. Doofenshmirtz yells and they charge at each other with their devices. The vacuum-like device sucks Doofenshmirtz's face) The Tornado Vac only needs one setting because of its painfully awesome suction power! (They go out onto the balcony and Doofenshmirtz backs into his Shrinkinator-plant and activates it several times. He gets out a notepad and pencil and writes something.) Shrinkinator, why haven't I unplugged this thing? I keep leaving myself notes, and I keep forgetting. ""Shrinkinator. Unplug Shrinkinator."" (He sticks the note onto the Shrinkinator.) Ugh! I'll do it tomorrow. (Pan to reveal all the notes say essentially the same thing.)"
Phineas, This is the final question. Winner takes all! (holds up a card) What is—?
Candace," Teddy bear stuffing! (covers her mouth, close up on Ferb, close up on the audience) Be a star, Candace! Be a star! Be a star! Come on! Be a star!"
Buford, Wow. Somebody's got issues.
Doofenshmirtz," (after landing near a hamburger flipper) Ha! I'll crush you with my Burgermatic hamburger flipper! (He turns it on, but the top parts simply spins around. He throws it away.) Alright, forget the Burgermatic. Let's see how you fare against my Shrinkinator! (Perry turns it on, and Doofenshmirtz shrinks.) Curse you— (Doofenshmirtz holds up his hand to reveal it is massive.) Hey! Hey, you missed my hand! Oh, now not only am I shrunken, but I'm freakishly shrunken! Curse you, Perry the Pl— (His giant hand practically crushes himself.) Aw, this is kind of heavy."
Phineas," Hey, look, our game show set instantaneously miniaturized itself!"
Ferb," Well, I suppose we could call that the home version."
Phineas," Well, we are home. Let's play it! (Perry chatters) There you are, Perry!"
Candace, So what? That's it? Who won? I am so busting you guys!
Jeremy," Hi, Candace."
Candace," Hi, Jeremy."
Jeremy," I saw ya on TV and just wanted to congratulate you. I guess you're, like, on a whole new level now."
Candace, What about your commercial?
Jeremy, (takes out his smartphone) You mean this?
