Narrator," This week, we ask ""Where Did They Go?"" about Pop Stars from the 80's... First up, this perky pop-star stole a One Wonder Hit by declaring ""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun."""
Candace," Hey, she looks familiar."
Narrator, Lindana's real name is Linda Flynn-Fletcher and she's now living in the Tri-State Area.
Candace," What? Mom, mom, mom!"
Phineas, I can't believe she didn't know that.
Candace," Mom, mom, mom, mom! You never told me you were a pop star!"
Linda," Oh yeah! Well, that was long before you were born. It was fun, but I was happy to give it up to raise a family."
Candace, But you were Lindana and you wanted to have fun!
Linda," Well, now I'm Linda and I wanna stir broth."
Phineas," (holding a cell phone) Mom, it's for you. He says he's a concert promoter."
Linda, Really?
Linda," An '80's revival concert featuring Lindana? Well, I don't know."
Candace, Are you crazy?!? Say yes!!!
Linda," Candace, it's been so long."
Candace," Come on! It'll be fun! And you'll be cool! And by extension, I'll be cool! (She smiles.)"
Linda," Oh, what the heck? (on phone) I'll do it!"
Candace, (jumping) Woohoo!
Phineas," Way to go, Mom!"
Lawrence," Yes, oh, yes, good on ya, honey. (chuckles)"
Linda," Okay, then, dinner's in the oven. Just heat it up. Bye!"
Candace, (popping out of the sunroof with her fists in the air) Rock and roll!
Lawrence," Oh, I was afraid that a day like today would come someday…today."
Phineas," Whadaya mean, Dad?"
Lawrence," Oh, your mother's going to meet a lot of exciting and cool people. What if I'm…I'm no longer cool enough for your mum? I'm hardly a rock star, am I? (walking away sadly) I""m afraid I'm hopelessly nerdy."
Phineas," (to his stepbrother) You know, Dad may be a little geeky for the new century, but in the '80s, the rise of the synthesizer allowed even hopeless nerds to rock the charts."
Ferb," Phineas, I know what we're going to do today!"
Phineas," Yes. Yes, you do. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P, there you are. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted playing with a hoop. See what he's up to. (Perry looks scornfully at Monogram.) That's it. That's all we got."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, (hula hooping) as you can see I've been struck by hooping fever. Go ahead, try it. (Perry starts hooping) Like this, yeah. Now do this, with your arms down. (Perry does so and the hoop traps him.) Oh, finally! My hips were about to fall off. Behold, the Alien-inator! It's a projector that will transmit holographic images of space aliens onto the steps of the Tri-State Capital. Then, when everyone is scared witless, I will emerge in my king of the aliens costume and seize control of the entire Tri-State Area. Hee hee! I'm gonna go put it on."
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, presenting that '80s superstar, Max Modem!"
Lawrence/Max," You know, I feel strangely comfortable like this. But how can I be a rock star if nobody's ever heard of me?"
Phineas, We're not trying to make you into a rock star. We're trying to make you into a has-been. That's much easier.
Stage Manager," (offscreen) Can I have Bag Your Face onstage for your sound check, please?"
Candace," Mom, this is so cool! I've dressed like half of these people here for Halloween! So what do we do now?"
Linda/Lindana," If I remember correctly: hair, makeup, wardrobe and a photo session."
Candace, A photo session?!
Linda/Lindana," The life of a rock star. Oh, it does have it's charms."
Montage," While ""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!"" plays in the background, Candace and Linda get made up. The scene transitions into a photo session. We then see Linda signing the photos of herself and Candace as Lindana. Candace then adds ""'s daughter"" and a heart to the signatures."
Doofenshmirtz," Are you ready? Don't peek. (Doofenshmirtz appears wearing an alien costume with a small crown on its head, a cape, and an inexplicable tan.) Ta-da! What, nothing? Wow, tough room."
Phineas," Okay, Dad, show me what you got."
Lawrence/Max, Right ho!
Phineas, Woah! Cut cut cut! That's a little too '70s for the '80s. Just check out Ferb.
Phineas," See, Dad? It's cool to show no effort. Let the technology and machines do the work. (All three push a button on their synths adding to the bass) Primo, Dad! I think you're ready for the big time!"
Lawrence/Max, Correction: I am ready to have once been part of the big time.
Phineas, Make way for Max Modem!
Man #1, Max Modem?
Man #2, Never heard of him.
Man #3, Didn't he do that song?
Woman #1," Yeah, yeah, yeah! I love that song!"
Man #4," Oh, I think I had one of his 45s!"
Woman #2, I had all his albums!
Man #5, How did he ever land here!
Woman #3, I sang backup for him in Prague!
All, (chanting) Modem! Modem! Modem! Modem!
Candace," Mom, who is that guy?"
Lindana," I don't know, but he does seem kind of familiar in a nerdy sort of way."
Doofenshmirtz," Alright, Perry the Platypus, (leading his nemesis to the inator) let's start by placing you right here. There you go. And then, I'll set the timer here. Mustn't forget to open the roof; (cut to an exterior shot of D.E.I. as the roof opens) a little something we learned from the Diarrhea-inator debacle. Right, Perry the Platypus? And set the timer for ten minutes so I can get to the steps of the Tri-State Capital building in time to lead my alien army! Ha! Oh, and don't get any bright ideas about thwarting me while I'm gone, because this inator, it's got a few tricks up its sleeve."
Candace," But I should be in the wings, Mom. The show's about to start."
Lindana," I wouldn't be here without you, honey. You backed me up all the way. So it's only right that you should back me up onstage."
Candace, Me? Sing?
Lindana, Just relax. You'll do fine.

Max Modem," Look at her, boys, she's magnificent."
Phineas," And you will be, too, Dad. Gentlemen, let's get our nerd on!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, good, I'm early! And a killer parking space, too! Score! Time to set up."
Passerby, Nutjob.
Doofenshmirtz," Now let's see. Take over the Tri-State Area speech, and water, in case I get parched during my maniacal rant. Hee hee. Loud-inator. (He gets up on a literal soap box and turns on his loud-inator.) Check, one, two, three."
Girl," Papa, Papa, I wanna see the clown!"
Girl's Father," Sally, he's no clown. He's a nutjob."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, ha ha ha! Laugh it up now! A-And when your friends ask what happened to Casual Fridays, you can tell them you opened your big mouth!"
Lindana," Good night, Danville!"
Candace, I can't believe I sang backup for Lindana!
Lindana," You can call me ""Mom""."
Candace," I just sang backup for Mom. Nah, just doesn't have the same ring."
Alien-inator," I am programmed to defend myself against all attacks. You cannot defeat me, Perry the Platypus. Time is up."
Doofenshmirtz," Elected officials of the Tri-State Area, look to the skies in horror! (The ""aliens"" arrive) You are being invaded from space by invaders from space! And I, the King of the Aliens, am here to accept your unconditional surrender!"
Man, I though he was a nutjob!
Woman," Me, too!"
Doofenshmirtz, Now bow down before me. Bow down and I will spare your menial jobs!
Man 2, Do we get to keep our healthcare benefits?
Stage Manager," (offscreen) Thirty seconds, Mr. Modem."
Lindana, Who is that guy?
Candace," You know, he really does look familiar."
Lindana," Yes. Yes, he does."
Announcer, And now (a spotlight hits Max's finger as he pushes a button) the band you've been waiting for: Max Modem and the Mainframes!

Fan-girl," Take my leg warmers, Max!"
Max Modem, ♪ From her alien heart! ♪
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, you can keep the 401(k), but the daycare you're gonna have to pay for out of your own pockets! I-I-I've made enough concessions!"
Alien-inator," Dr. Doofenshmirtz has programmed me with all of his vast knowledge of you. Your secret agent skills are useless. (Agent P thinks for a moment, then takes off his fedora and goes into mindless pet mode and chatters.) Perry the Platypus, where did you go? I was not informed that your agency had developed a cloaking device. Here, Perry. Perry. Come to— (Perry jumps on the inator toppling it over. The ""aliens"" disappear.)"
Man, Look! The aliens are disappearing!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great. Now I am a nutjob."
Max Modem, ♪ She's got an alien heart! ♪
Max Modem,"We're Max Modem and the Mainframes! Thank you, Tri-State Area!"
Lindana," Nice work, ""Max."" You've still got it. Although I can't say I remember you having it in the first place."
Max Modem, You weren't so bad yourself. What say we go out for a spot of tea sometime?
Linda," Oh, no thanks. I've got an absolutely wonderful husband back home."
Max Modem," (removing his shades) Yeah, well, you better believe it, Ducky."
Lindana, (embracing her husband) But what did you do all this for?
Max Modem, I just thought you might like it if I were a bit more exciting.
Lindana," Oh, Lawrence, you and the kids are all the excitement I could ever want."
Phineas," (holding the phone) Mom, it's the promoter again! He wants to sign you and Max Modem for an extended tour!"
Lindana, Tell him thanks but no thanks.
Candace," WHAT?!?! But what about the coolness, the fame and the fortune?!"
Max Modem," Oh, Candace, we don't need those things to be happy."
Lindana, All we need is you guys.
Phineas, Right. Who wants to go on tour when there's so much to do around here this summer?
Candace," Oh, okay. (Agent P jet packs his way down behind her, takes off his fedora and goes back into mindless pet mode.) But if anyone calls offering me a concert deal I'm takin' it!"
Phineas," So, Mom, after all these years, how'd you keep your voice in such great shape?"
Lindana," Oh, I was lip-synching. Even back then! (Perry chatters) Oh, there you are, Perry!"
