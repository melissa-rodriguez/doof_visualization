Linda," Well, I think that's it. You have both our cell-phone numbers, all emergency contacts, and the number of the hotel we'll be staying in at the antique shower-head convention. What do you plan on doing tonight?"
Candace," I thought I'd have a few friends over, like Stacy and Jenny. Is that okay?"
Linda, Sure! But no wild parties.
Candace," Well, I guess I'll have to cancel the death metal band and the fire dancers. (Linda frowns) I kid!"
Linda," Lawrence, you're not wearing that on the plane."
Lawrence, (wearing antique showerhead) I'm not on the plane yet.
Linda, We'll be back this time tomorrow.
Phineas," Mom and Dad, your cab is here."
Linda, (To Candace) Bye hon! You're in charge.
Lawrence," Mind your sister, boys."
All, Bye!
Candace," Hey, Stace. What're you doing tonight? Do you and Jenny want to come over and just hang out?"
Phineas, Do you need help with entertaining or snacks?
Candace," Listen, under no circumstances do I want you to do anything crazy. Or anything at all for that matter. Just go up to your room and get out of my hair. Vamoose."
Phineas," Are you sure? We can make a nacho launcher, or a dip fountain."
Candace, No.
Phineas, How about a wasabi slide?
Candace," No. (To Stacy) Sorry about that, Stace. Come over around... Oh wait, I have another call. Hello?"
Phineas, (from the phone) How about a mustard-go-round?
Candace, Phineas!
Phineas," Okay. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Come in, Agent P. We've been having trouble with our pipes getting mixed up with the city's dump system. We aren't one hundred percent sure where you'll end up."
Doofenshmirtz, Perry the Platypus?!
Major Monogram," Where are you, Agent P? (Perry points his wrist communicator at Doofenshmirtz) Great googly moogly! Well, hang tight, I'll give you your mission. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. He has been seen snooping around-"
Doofenshmirtz," Around the neighborhood apartment. Yes, I've; yes, I've been doing that."
Major Monogram, He's also been buying-
Doofenshmirtz, Buying electrical equipment.
Major Monogram, And checking-
Both, -movie starting times online.
Major Monogram, Let me tell it!
Doofenshmirtz, I wanna tell it! I - want - to tell it! Doofenshmirtz... that is... wait... (he is cut off by Major Monogram; exclaims in frustration)
Major Monogram," La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. (clears throat) So, get him, Agent P, and good luck."
Doofenshmirtz, Thank you.
Major Monogram, Not you.
Doofenshmirtz," Too late, I'm lucky now. (laughs; traps Perry) You like that? I call it a trap-a-lounger, because it's loungy and trappy all at the same time."
Stacy, Yeah!
Jenny, Whoo-hoo!
Stacy, (she and Jenny walk in) I took the liberty of bringing some DVDs for our party viewing pleasure.
Candace," Uh, it's not a party."
Stacy," For our not-a-party viewing pleasure. (Enter Jenny's cousin, Sara)"
Jenny," Candace, this is my cousin, Sara."
Sara, Hello.
Jenny," She's visiting for the weekend. Is it okay if she hangs out with us, too?"
Candace," Well, my mom said I could have a couple people over. Sure, come on in."
Sara," (Candace closes the door) Hey, are you Phineas and Ferb's sister? That must be awesome for you."
Candace," Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?"
Stacy," So my mom told me to clean up my room and I didn't have any shoes on, so I started picking stuff up with my feet, and I turned it into a game with myself, like, ""Can I Clean Up My Whole Room With My Feet?"" And I did. (her cell phone rings) Oh, it's Coltrane. Hello?"
Coltrane, (indistinct chattering over phone)
Stacy, (To Candace) Coltrane and Jeremy's gig got cancelled. Can they come over?
Candace," Over here? Uh, Coltrane and Jeremy? Hey, what's two more?"
Stacy, (to Coltrane) Bring it! (she hangs up) Awesome!
Doofenshmirtz," So, let me tell you my evil scheme. Not too long ago, I used to sit right over there and watch free movies on the drive-in movie screen across the street. Of course, I didn't get the sound, so I'd make up my own dialogue. It was fun. (changes his tone of voice to sound gruff and deeper) Sheila, I love you, but now I have to defuse this bomb. (in normal voice) See? Good stuff! Gripping! But now look! They built a giant condominium blocking my view. I tried to make up dialogue for it... (in gruff movie voice) I'm a condominium. I'm just standing there. (In normal voice) See? Where's the fun in that? It's always the same, ""I'm a building."" There's no story. And I know what you're thinking, why not just move my armchair over to that window over there with the unblocked view? Well, then I would have to move this little table, too, and the lamp, and this is the only electrical outlet. It seems easier to get rid of the building. So, that's why I invented this: the Go-Away-inator! One blast of this ray, and that building, and everyone in it, (snaps his fingers) will instantly be transported somewhere else. Here on this wheel, I've written many undesirable locations. With a pull of this string, a site is randomly chosen, and good-bye low-rent condo, hello Hollywood high-budgets! (laughs maniacally)"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. Thanks for having us over to your party."
Candace," Oh, it's not a party, and I'm glad you and your entire band could make it over."
Jeremy, We wrote a new song. I'd love to test it out on you guys.
Stacy, Aww.
Jenny/Sara, Ooh.
Candace," Uh, as long as we agree that it's just a test. This isn't a ""party"" with a ""band"" playing, it's just a small get-together, and you're just gonna lightly strum a test song."
Jeremy, ♪ It's funny how words ♪
Girl #1," Hey, we were just walking by and heard the music. Isn't this Phineas and Ferb's house?"
Candace," Well, yes, but..."
Girl #1, Awesome!
Girl #3," Hey, Phineas and Ferb are having a party!"
Candace," But, but, but, hold on... (chuckles nervously) It's just an intimate get together. (tries to close the door, but gets slammed in the face as more teens walk in)"
Teens," Hey, Phineas and Ferb!/Hey, guys, a party!"
Candace, It's not a party.
Girl, This is awesome! (more teens join in Jeremy and the Incidentals and dance along)
Phineas, Heeeeeey.
Ferb," When we get our own place, it'll be like this everyday."
Phineas, Let's find Candace.
Candace," No, no! No, keep it down. Just going to turn it down a little. (chuckles nervously) ♪ La, la, la... ♪ (tries to unplug the amplifier, but Phineas and Ferb interrupt her)"
Phineas," Hey, Candace. Cool party."
Candace," It's not a party, it's an intimate get-together."
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. Thanks so much for hosting this."
Candace," Oh, sure. Rock on... (Jeremy leaves) What are you looking at?! If you want to stay down here, sit over there and stay out of the way."
Phineas, (leaving) Okay.
Guy," Pork Rinds, coming your way!"
Candace," Uh, snacks should not be airborne! (Snatches it from him but the bag tears and the chips fall to the ground)"
Doofenshmirtz," Any minute now, Perry the Platypus, that building will be relocated and I can enjoy my view! It just needs to warm up. (turns on the Go-Away-inator) Let's savor this moment. Right now, my plan is working, you're trapped, and the inator is warming up. Yes, these are the good moments, Perry the Platypus. These are the good moments."
Guy, Is this the Phineas and Ferb party?
Guy #2, Sure is.
Guy, I brought Pork Rinds.
Guy #2, More pork rinds!
Candace, I didn't invite these people. Who are they? Now what?
Party members, (Chanting) Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip!
Candace, What's going on here?
Party members, Yeah!
Candace, Stop encouraging them!
Phineas, We're just eating potato chips at a party.
Guy, Phineas and Ferb parties rule! (all cheering)
Guy,"Candace It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. (Shattering) (Gasps) What was that? Put that down, pardon me, use a napkin! What's my science teacher doing here?"
Teacher, I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party!
Candace," First of all, it's not a party, but if it were a party, it would not be their party, it would be MY PARTY!"

Candace, (gasp) The entire party has disappeared! Of course! The same divine intervention that takes things away from you guys...took the party away for me! I'm saved!
Phineas, I wonder where the party went.
Ferb," Someplace nice, I hope."
Dr. Doofenshmirtz," Well, obviously, something's amiss. Uhh, let's review: The Go-away inator which missed the condo, should've zapped whatever it hit to an undesirable location. Let me check my undesirable location wheel. (grabs out binoculars) Stonehenge, Burbank... (looks where spinner stopped) My Pants?! Why would I even write that there? Oh, I see, I got it confused with my dry-cleaning wheel. Oh, okay, but...why do I have a dry-cleaning wheel? (in gruff movie voice) I am a dry-cleaning wheel. Why do I exist? (normal voice) Perry the Platypus, be a mensch and push the reverse button, would you?"
Candace, Mom and Dad are here!
Candace," Hello, Mother, Father. What are you doing back so soon? I hope everything's okay. (pause) There's a party behind me, isn't there?"

Ferb," Totally, a platypus would have put it over the edge."

Vanessa, How did my life get to the point where that is not a strange sentence to me?
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, (in gruff movie voice) I'm your daughter. I will stop being sarcastic and untie you.
