Linda, No.
Candace," Okay, but it is the mall, right?"
Lawrence," No, it's not the mall."
Candace, Wait. Please don't tell me we're going to Mt. Rushmore.
Linda, Isn't it great? Four American presidents carved into a side of a mountain.
Lawrence, It was Phineas and Ferb's idea!
Phineas, You're welcome.
Lawrence, Okay. You lot go on ahead. I'll find a parking spot and meet you there.
Phineas," We're going up to the monument. Come on, Perry."

Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good again. We just discovered his new hideout is located inside Lincoln's head at Mt. Rushmore. I-I know. You were just there. Poor planning on our part, actually. Sorry."
Candace, Phineas?! Ferb?! Ohh.
Man," Hey, Honey. What are them kids doing up on the monument?"
Candace," Let me see that. [Gasps] Mom! Mom, you've got to see this now. Here, look!"

Candace, Mom! You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!
Ranger," [On megaphone] Uh, excuse me. Aren't you a little young to be restoring a national monument?"
Ferb, [Holds megaphone]
Phineas," [On megaphone] Yes. Yes, we are."
Ranger," Well, it's good to see young people taking an interest in our national heritage."
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, [Grunting and screaming]
Computer Voice, Hull overheating. Hull overheating.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, The molted lava of the earth's core completely slipped my mind.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz,Oh no! THE LAVA IS FOLLOWING US!!!
Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"The lava is being diverted. You did it, Perry the Platypus! You saved us!"
Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"I hate to be a stickler, but the lava is coming AGAIN!!! FASTER!"
Candace, Wait 'till you see what those two are up to!
Isabella, She's coming.
Isabella,She's getting closer!
Phineas, We're running a little behind on schedule. Go to Plan B.
Isabella," Plan B, girls!"
Candace," You are gonna be shocked by what I'm about to show you, Mom."
Linda," Hmm. I guess things look better in photos. [Phone rings] Oh, it's Dad."
Lawrence," Hi, honey! I found an absolutely brilliant parking space!"
Linda," Great! I'll meet you at the gift shop, dear. I still have to buy that big stick."

Candace," No! No, no, this is a great thing. Oh, it's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me!"
Linda," You know, Candace, this is the second time I've climbed up there! I'm already down a half a dress size!"
Candace, Come on! Hurry!
Dr. Doofenshmirtz," AAH! Wait, where are you going? AAH! [Crash] I'm okay, I... OH NO!!!!! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Candace," Hurry, Mom! You won't believe it! [Rumbling]"
Candace,Huh?
Candace,EW!
Linda," Whew! Finally made it, honey. Now what is it you wanted me to see?"
Candace, Bu...bu...!
Linda," You're right! It's beautiful. Happy birthday, honey. [Kisses] Now let's go find your father."
Candace, Ugh!
