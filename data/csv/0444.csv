Phineas, (gasps)
Isabella, Whatcha doin'?
Phineas," Oh, hi, Isabella. We were just building a polymer de-stabilizer for the binding catalyst of the—"
Isabella," That's great, Phineas. Listen, uh, there's something I wanna tell you."
Phineas, Okay.
Isabella," Uh, it's about this patch."
Phineas," Oh, it's one of your accomplishment patches."
Isabella," Yeah, but...it's an Emotional Bravery Patch that I can only earn by walking up to somebody I—"
Ferb, (clears his throat offscreen)
Phineas," Nice, Ferb! You found the new power supply!"
Isabella," Um, Phineas? I, uh—"
Buford," Hey, what's shakin', bacon?"
Baljeet, You do realize that bacon does not shake.
Buford, Sir Francis Bacon?
Baljeet, I stand corrected.
Phineas, We're building a rubberization ray to give our skin rubber-like qualities. C'mon! We'll show you!
Isabella," (sighs, to herself) So you see, Phineas, I can only earn the patch by walking up to someone I care about and telling them face-to-face that I've got a huge crush on you."
Phineas, Remember how much fun it was to bounce around the world on a rubber ball?
Baljeet, If not a bit nauseating.
Buford, That was the fun part!
Phineas," So, how awesome would it be to actually be a rubber ball?"
Buford, I'm in! Can we shoot Perry with it and bounce him around the backyard like a plat-a-ball?
Phineas," Um, no. But where is Perry?"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P, I see you found the new central air conditioning entrance."
Perry, (Chatters angrily)
Major Monogram," What? Oh, the hot tub. Purely therapeutic. The bubbles work wonders on a bad back. (The bubbles stop) Carl!"
Carl," (exhales) I'm a little lightheaded, sir. Can I take a break?"
Major Monogram, What am I not paying you for?!
Carl," Yes, sir. (inhales)"
Major Monogram," Anyhoo, today's the unveiling of Danville's new water tower. Mayor Doofenshmirtz is going to be dedicating it tonight at his press conference. We're fairly certain that Doof'll attempt to disrupt the event in some way. Not only is it high profile, but, since it's right next door to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, it's also extremely convenient. So get out there and stop him from doing whatever it is he is gonna... (the bubbles stop again) Carl! Bubbles!"
Carl," (offscreen) Yes, sir. (groans and faints)"
Major Monogram, Fine. You've got five minutes.
Major Monogram,Act II
Candace," (offscreen) Ooh, Stacy, the new issue of Blasé Teen is out."
Candace," You should see the models in these spreads. So indifferent. So uninterested. So cool! (puts magazine back on rack) I wonder if you and I will ever be this cool. What are you doing, Stacy?"
Stacy," I'm trying to hook up this super-high-def-intelligent-multi-format-entertainment-DVR system. I wanna keep the DVD and the VCR but I don't think there are enough holes. I mean, there's also a pretty serious clicker situation."
Candace," Well, I'm no help to you there. Talk to you later, Stace. Good luck. (hangs up and looks at the magazine again) I wish I knew a girl like this so I could hang out and absorb her coolness. (She puts the magazine down to see Vanessa making the same pose as the model in the magazine.) (gasps) Vanessa! Hey, Vanessa! Vanessa! Hey! Hey!"
Vanessa," Oh, hey, Candace."
Candace," So, uh, doin' some shoppin'? I mean, duh! Of course, you're shopping. You've got the items in the little basket thingy. You placed them in there with the intent to— Stop, Candace."
Vanessa," Yeah, I'm just buyin' some snacks. Some of the girls are coming over later for a movie night. Should be cool."
Candace, (excitedly) Wow! That sounds incredibly awesomely— (indifferently) Yeah. Cool. Whatevs.
Vanessa, You wanna come?
Candace," Y'know, lemme just call my mom. I'd tell her I'd get those squirrels out of the— (Vanessa leaves) Oh, oh, we're going now. (Candace follows her.)"
Doofenshmirtz," Woohoo! Time to boogie, baby! Whoo! Whoo! My hustle's out of muscle but I can still shake my brick house or whatever the kids are calling it these days. (a kitchen timer dings) Norm, get the doonkelberry pie out of the oven, wouldja?"
Norm," You got it, sir!"
Doofenshmirtz," (turns the music off) Vanessa's having some friends over for a little get-together, but I digress. Behold! The Repulse-inator! Whoever I hit with this inator will automatically become repulsive. (pushes the inator closer to the edge of the balcony) And, wouldn't you know it, my brother, Roger, is dedicating a new Danville water tower right below my ledge! Once he's hit by a beam from this baby, he'll become so abominable, so disgusting, so hideous, so noxious, so grotesque, (cut to reveal Doof reading from a thesaurus) so ghastly... Uh, anyway, Roger will become so repulsive that his popularity will plunge and mine will skyrocket by comparison, facilitating moi to take over the entire Tri-State Area! (Perry gives him a look) Don't look at me like that! I gotta good feeling about today! It's gonna happen. The only trouble with it is that this particular inator requires a lot more power than any other inator I've created for some bizarre reason. And, uh, I only have one functioning wall outlet in the lab. (cut to reveal the wall outlet overloaded with electrical wires and things) So, I'm gonna put a lot of strain on that."
Norm," Your pie, sir."
Doofenshmirtz," Thank you, Norm. Owwww!! Ow! This is hot!"
Norm," Oops. Sorry, sir."
Doofenshmirtz, Did that just come right out of the oven?
Norm," (offscreen) Well, my hands are metal."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, now, mine are bacon, apparently. (shakes his hands) Look, I'm shakin' bacon! You like that? It's a callback to something I didn't even hear! In your face, logic!"
Norm," Here's a potholder, sir."
Doofenshmirtz," Thank you. (to Perry) I'm gonna take this downstairs to Vanessa. Party on, Perry the Platypus! (he flips the switch and the music and disco lights resume)"
Phineas," Ready, Baljeet?"
Baljeet, Okay! (he gets zapped) Wuh! I still feel the same.
Phineas, Try jumping up and down a little bit.
Buford, Oh oh! Now me! (he gets zapped) Woohoo! Awesome!
Phineas," Me, next! (He gets zapped.) C'mon, Isabella!"
Isabella, Hit me with your bounce shot! (She gets zapped.)
Phineas, All right!
Gretchen," (to Adyson) Isabella said she'd be here, so she'll be here."
Holly," I bet you all the muffins that wherever she is, it has somethin' to do with Phineas."
Isabella, Girls! (taps again)
Isabella," Hi, Gretch!"
Gretchen, Where've you been?
Isabella, I was over at Phineas' house and was rubberized by a machine they built.
Gretchen, Holly gets the muffins!
Isabella," Look, you know that Emotional Bravery Patch I was all set to earn?"
Gretchen, Yeah.
Isabella," Well, I'm totally blowing it! I feel strong when I walk up to Phineas, but as soon as I open my mouth, I completely choke!"
Gretchen," Oh, Isabella, you're overthinking it!"
Gretchen," ♪ You better jump right to it, ♪"
Gretchen and the Fireside Girls, ♪ You've been waitin' all summer ♪
Gretchen, ♪ You've gotta step right up ♪
Gretchen and the Fireside Girls, ♪ This isn't the time ♪
Ginger," ♪ Why you waiting, Isabella? ♪"
Fireside Girls, ♪ So it makes us somewhat frantic. ♪
Gretchen," ♪ Go on and get it, ♪"
Ginger, ♪ You can earn a new patch. ♪
Fireside Girls," ♪ All summer long, ♪"
Isabella," You're right! I should tell Phineas how I feel! Later, girls! Gotta bounce! (jumps out the window and bounces back up) Literally!"
Vanessa, So I thought we could watch this foreign art film I found. Le Coeur Noir De Douleur et de la Tristesse Douce.
Dana, Is that the one that's the neo-realistic portrayal of women's angst?
Heather," No, that's the other one. This one is about ennui."
Candace, Don't know if I've seen that one. Is it animated?
Lacie," So, Janice..."
Candace, Candace.
Lacie, Nice black nail polish. And only on one finger? Rad.
Candace," Oh, it's actually a bruise. (chuckles) I slammed it in a drawer. Yeah, I think it's probably gonna fall off soon."
Birgitte, Did you download the new Young Apparatus album?
Lacie," No way. They're sellouts. I'm only listening to Coffin Shadows now. They're so independent, they pay you to download their songs."
Candace, Hmm. Coffin Shadows? I've never heard of them.
Lacie, New skirt?
Birgitte," Yeah, I turned it inside out, ripped it in half and then sewed it back together."
Lacie, Get your brother to drive over it a few times. It really weathers it.
Candace, (chuckles) Wow! You guys know everything.
Doofenshmirtz," Hello, ladies! I'm here with homemade doonkelberry pie!"
Vanessa," Dad, I thought you were going to stay upstairs! I've got the snacks covered."
Doofenshmirtz," But, pookie, I thought you loved the doonkel-boonkel."
Vanessa," (takes the pie) Yes, I do love it and thank you, but (closes the door on him) please, Dad."
Doofenshmirtz, A-Are you watchin' foreign films?
Vanessa, Dad!
Doofenshmirtz, Maybe-Maybe I could join you guys for a lively discussion.
Vanessa," Goodbye, Dad."
Doofenshmirtz," Y'know, I-I-I-I can't stay anyway. As we speak, my nemesis is upstairs trying to work free from a trap that... So even if...if you wanted me to stay, I, uh... (she shuts the door on him) Bye."
Candace," Stacy, this is amazing! I'm at an actual party with cool older girls! They know everything! They're so AHHHH! They're awesome! You've gotta get over here."
Stacy," Candace, I am so proud of myself! I think I totally hooked this thing up! It's incredible! It has picture-in-picture-in-picture! I'll be able to watch a show and then another show inside that show and then the first show again inside that one! And I managed to get it down to one clicker! I'm about to give it a whirl! (She points and clicks, but it turns off and on the TV of a neighbor's house behind her.) Hmm. (The neighbor behind her gets up and sees his TV turn on and off again in frustration.) Okay. Maybe there's still a bug or two to fix."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, party's over, Perry the Platy—"
Doofenshmirtz," Ow! Oh! Ah, man! Ah! Uh, not to be high-maintenance or anything, but d-do you mind we could fight a little quieter? Uh, the girls are watching a movie and I don't wanna dis— I didn't mean you to walk away. (Perry comes back with pillows.) I mean we could continue to fight. It's just they're so— (Perry whacks him with a pillow) A pillow fight! Perfect! It's violent and quiet! It is on!"
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, come on! Do I get to land one or not? (Perry hits him in the face with a pillow.) I take that as a no? (Perry flings Doof and he hits a wall. Doof spits out some feathers.) Talk about ""down in the mouth"". Get it? It's, uh... Ah, whatever. Meet my friends, (holds up couch cushions) Poly and Ester! (He throws ""Poly"" over at Perry.)"
Doofenshmirtz, (offscreen) Uh-oh! I think it's overheating!
Roger, The dedication—
Doofenshmirtz, Run! It's gonna blow!
Doofenshmirtz," Ha! Trapped ya! You'll fall for anything, Perry the Platypus! (mockingly) ""It's gonna blow!"" (normal voice) As if, as if I would know ahead of time when something's going to—"
Doofenshmirtz," That was purely coincidental. But, hey! I hit Roger! Oh, he's gonna be repulsive now!"
Doof zombie (Roger), (groans)
Doofenshmirtz, (angrily) I get it. Repulsive. I see. That's just the universe making a joke at my expense!
Busty Woman, (gasps) What happened to Mayor Doofenshmirtz?!
Doof zombie (Roger), Lots of me...
Doof zombie (Melanie), Lots of me...
Doof zombies, Lots of me...
Man 1, No no no! Aaaaah!
Doof zombies, Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me....
Doof zombies,Act III
Phineas, Woohoo!
Isabella," Phineas! Hey, Phineas, I need to talk to you!"
Phineas, Okay.
Isabella," No, (stops him from bouncing) I really need to talk to you and I'm just gonna jump right to it! The thing about that Emotional Bravery Patch is that I need to tell you..."
Mrs. Feyersied, (offscreen) No! No! No! Get away! Aaah!
Isabella," Mrs. Feyersied? (to Phineas) One second please. (Isabella runs over, lifts up her belt and instantly changes into her Fireside Girl uniform.) Good evening, ma'am. Fireside Girl Isabella Garcia-Shapiro Troop 46231. What's the emergency?"
Mrs. Feyersied, Pharmacists! Pharmacists!!!
Isabella, What does that even mean?
Phineas, What's everybody running from?
Baljeet," Uh, perhaps that?"
Phineas, (offscreen) Irving?
Irving," Hi, guys!"
Baljeet," (offscreen) No, that! Over there!"
Doof zombies, Lots of me... Lots of me...
Buford," Well, that sure wiggles my biscuits."
"Phineas, Buford and Baljeet", Run!!!
Buford, What was that?!
Phineas," It's...some kind of pharmacist! And if he touches you, you turn into a pharmacist, too!"
Buford, I can't be a pharmacist! I know nothing about pharmaceuticals!
Baljeet, Then we gotta make sure those things never touch us!
Doof zombie, (touches Baljeet) Lots of me...
Buford, Stay back! You're infected!
Phineas," Buford, put me down!"
Baljeet, I...I am okay! Really!
Buford, (puts Phineas down) Why are you okay?
Baljeet, I do not know!
Ferb, Perhaps our rubberized skin might be acting as an insulator.
Phineas, Of course! The contagion must be transmitted by electrostatic charge!
Doof zombies," Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas," Let's bounce, guys! (They bounce away. Phineas comes back down.) Literally. (He bounces back up.)"
Baljeet, How long is the rubberization effect supposed to last?
Phineas, Not much longer!
Buford, I wanna recharge!
Phineas, Good idea! Let's get back to the backyard and re-rubberize!
Gordon Gutsofanemu," Good evening, I'm Gordon Gutsofanemu with a special report. The Tri-State Area is in chaos tonight as thousands of repulsive mindless pharmacists run rampant all over Danville!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, there they go with the whole ""pharmacist"" thing again! I-I should become one, that-that would show 'em! I should become a pharmacist!"
Gordon Gutsofanemu," We now go live on the scene with our own Action News reporter, Don Adaded. Don?"
Don Adaded," Thanks, Gordon. I'm standing here in downtown Danville. It's an unbelievable scene. Pharmacists touching people who turn into pharmacists. Ah, here's one of them now. Mr. Mindless Repulsive Pharmacist, care to comment?"
Doof zombie, Lots of me... (touches Don)
Don Adaded," And there you have it, folks. I'm..."
Doof zombie (Don Adaded), Lots of me...
Gordon Gutsofanemu, (clearly frightened) Thanks...Don. L-Let's go to the weather.
Doof zombie (Weatherman), Lots of me...let's go to traffic...
Doof zombie (pilot), Lots of me...
Doof zombie (co-pilot)," Back to you, Gordon..."
Doof zombie (Gordon Gutsofanemu), Lots of me...
Doofenshmirtz," I don't believe it! An entire army of mes! Heh heh! (runs to the elevator) Oh! For once, I'll actually be able to take over the Tri-State Area 'cause I'll have, you know, the volume. Ciao, baby!"

They will all soon learn to fear the name of Dr. Heinz Doofenshm— (The Doof zombies walk away.) Hey, come back here! You guys are my army!"
Doof zombies," Lots of me...,etc."
Phineas, Hurry! We're losing our bounce!
Baljeet, Oh no! The pharmacists trashed the machine! Can we rebuild it?
Phineas," We can try, but we should do it inside. There's too many pharmacists out here. Our rubberization is fading fast."
Buford, (attempts to bounce but falls) I DIDN'T BOUNCE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Phineas, (closing the sliding door) Okay. We gotta get started on another rubberization ray.
Buford, (runs and screams)
Phineas, Right after we calm down Buford.
Stacy," Yes! Next, popcorn."
Doof zombie," Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
Stacy," And so begins The Grievance movie marathon. Special edition box set. Oh, yeah. ""Hey, Stacy, didja hook up that whole system by yourself?"" ""Yeah, no biggie. Do it all the time."" Heh heh. I rule."
Candace, So this is a French film subtitled in Spanish. Why is that lady wearing a goat head?
Birgitte, Art isn't art unless it's difficult.
Candace, Mmm-hmm.
Doof zombie, (growls)
Lacie," Hey, Vanessa? Your dad's at the door."
Vanessa," Ugh! It's okay, don't pause it. (She opens the door to reveal three Doof zombies behind it.)"
Doof zombies," Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
Vanessa," Okay. (closes door) Something's weird here, because I know I only have one of those. Lemme call him and see what's up. Hmm. Voicemail. Odd. Dad, your weird clone-thingies are down here. Could you please just—"
Vanessa, Aaaaaahh!!
Doof zombies," Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
Punk girls, Aaaaaaahhh!!! (they run away)
Vanessa," Come on, Candace! Come on, come on! Get in! (they run into her bedroom and close the door) Okay, that's really wrong. Even by my dad's standards."
Dana," Check it out! (looks at her phone) It's all over the web! This isn't just going on in this building. They're all over town and according to this, if one touches you, you become one of them!"
Punk Girls, Ewwww!
Lacie, We're doomed!
Candace, What's the big deal? I see weird stuff like this all the time.
Birgitte, I want my mommy!
Lacie, Life's gonna end and I'm wearing a fake tattoo!
Heather," Someone's gotta help us! I mean, we're in danger!"
Candace," (through the side of her mouth) What a bunch of babies. (gasps) Wait a minute! Weird situation plus danger equals Phineas and Ferb! Okay, calm down. I'm on it! (dials her phone) Mom? Mom, I want you to check and see if the boys are creating zombies!"
Linda," Oh, I love it when teenagers get together and do party pranks! Do you win the game if I actually do what you say?"
Baljeet, This has taken considerably longer than I have ever imagined!
Phineas," Buford, chill out! You're fine!"
Buford," Whadaya mean, ""fine""? I've got no bounce left! I'm totally unprotected!"
Phineas, We'll build another rubberization ray.
Baljeet," Yes. It is not as if society has crumbled, Buford. The phone networks are still up."
Phineas, We still have electric power.
Baljeet, And water is still flowing out the tap.
Buford, (offscreen) Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!
Candace," Mom? Mom, are you there? Something weird is going on! Not the usual weird! A different, not-normal weird!"
Vanessa, This is not my dad's everyday weird either.
Candace, Something tells me I shoulda just hung out at Stacy's.
Stacy, (to the TV) Look out! She's right behind you! (the power shuts off) Ugh! You gotta be kiddin' me! Talk about Grievance interruptus. (gets off the couch)
Linda, I just love blackouts. They're kind of exciting in a way.
Lawrence," Yeah, oh, yes. And it's one of the few times you get to meet your neighbors."
Doof zombie, Lots of me...
Lawrence, Like this fellow here. Hello. Pleased to meet you. I'm Lawrence.
"Doof zombie, Doof zombie (Linda) and Doof zombie (Lawrence)", Lots of me...
Phineas," Oh no! They got Mom and Dad! And without power, there's no way to repair the circuits!"
Buford," Game over, man! We're doomed!"
Baljeet," No! There is always a way! Isabella teaches the emergency preparedness class for the Fireside Girls. She could build a generator in her sleep. Is that not right, Isabella? (who is not here)"
Phineas, Isabella? I...I thought she was... Didn't anyone... Who saw her last? (He freaks out just like Buford.)
Buford," ""Buford, chill out. You're fine."" I'm vindicated."

Perry,Act IV
Doofenshmirtz," Lots of me... Naw, I'm just kidding! It's...It's me! But those guys are annoying, aren't they? Anyway, welcome to my Startle Space. I wanted a panic room, but it was just prohibitively expensive. I just had to get to a place where I could clear my head, man. Those other mes, they're really workin' my last nerve. ""Lots of me... Lots of me..."" One of me is fine, but, ih, I can really be annoying en masse. I'll admit it. So, uh, are you hungry? I got plenty of food. (Perry takes down a can of almond brittle.) Or maybe you wanna play a game. I got some old Drusselstein board games here, like, ooh, ""Kleptocracy""! Vanessa used to love this game when she was a— (gasps) Vanessa! Oh no! She's still in the building! We need to stop those mes before they get to her or, or she could turn into me! That's every child's worst nightmare! Well, (Stammers) not me, specifically, other children are afraid of turning into me. It's just that I'm saying turning into your parent. That's what's scary. (gasps) Vanessa! Vanessa! (He runs out the door.)"
Doof zombie," Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas, (offscreen) I can't believe we left her!
Phineas, (pacing) I hope she's okay. She's just gotta be! I'm gonna check the periscope again. Maybe she's back by now.
Baljeet, I will do it.
Phineas," Thanks, Baljeet."
Baljeet, Oh. Nothing but pharmacists as far as the periscope can see.
Phineas," Man, I hope she's okay. (sighs) If she's been turned into a pharmacist, I'll never forgive myself."
Baljeet," Do not worry, Phineas. With all of her training, she will be fine. Just last week, she earned her Judo, Hapkido, and Jujitsu Patches."
Phineas," Judo? Hapkido? But those are all grappling techniques! And if she touches one of them, then... ih... Wait, wait. I bet she's at Fireside Girl Headquarters! We've got to go there!"
Baljeet, But that is all the way across town!
Buford, We can't go out there unprotected! We're sittin' ducks!
Phineas," Since our rubberization machine is toast, we're gonna need some sort of insulating armor. Hey, Ferb, do we have any rubber lying around?"
Phineas," Two steps ahead as always. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do tonight!"
Stacy," (scoffs) Figures. The power goes out right in the middle of the movie. Good thing I got the power generator package option. Okay, let's see. (reading manual) ""For your safety, please make sure to wear included protective gear when operating the generator."""
Stacy," Great! Here we go! (A Doof zombie attempts to stalk behind her, but she pulls the chord and unintentionally punches the zombie unconscious.) Nice! Hooked up a video system and a generator! I am good!"
Doof zombies, Lots of me...
Shaun," Don't touch me! I don't want to be a pharmac—! Wait a second... That doesn't even make sense. You get touched by a pharmacist, you become a pharmacist? I mean, you can't just grow a lab coat."
Ed," I don't know, perhaps the disease infects your clothin' as well."
Shaun, Infects my c— Are you insinuating that my clothes are alive? That's scarier than these pharmacist saying... (gets touched and transforms)
Doof zombie (Shaun), Lots of me...

(static) Agent P, we need you to find the source of the contagion and protect those who haven't been infected. You're our last hope."
Carl, You're the Omega Platypus! But no pressure! Oh!
Major Monogram," (transforming) Good luck, Agent P. Good—"
Doof zombie (Major Monogram), Lots of me... Lots of me...
Doof zombie (Carl), Lots of me... I used to be Carl...
Phineas," Okay, guys. Fireside Girls Headquarters is only a couple of blocks away."
Phineas," Whoa! Look alive, boys!"
Doof zombies," Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
Buford," Oh, hey, it's a dog. Here boy! (whistles)"
Doof zombie (Agent G), Baaa...
Doof zombie (Agent O), (hoots)
Phineas, What the?
Doof zombie (Agent M), (screeches)
Phineas, Oh no! The contagion must have a different effect on animals!
Phineas, They're following us!
Buford," Hold on! I'll try to lose 'em! Feet up, Ferb!"
Phineas, Looks like we lost 'em!
Buford, Yes and no! Aaaaaaahhhh!
Doofenshmirtz," Vanessa! Vanessa! Alright, alright, party's over! I've had it up to here with you mes! Y'know, I'm really getting sick of the sound of my own voice. Now I understand where Charlene was coming from."
Doof zombies," (crowding Doof) Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
Doofenshmirtz, AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Doof zombies, Less of me... Less of me... Less of me...
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, typical. Typical. Yeah, turn on your creator. You guys are all cliché, I'm just letting you know!"
Doofenshmirtz,Act V
Candace, That should hold 'em.
Vanessa," Okay, guys, we gotta figure out a plan."
Birgitte, We should totally split up!
Lacie, I'm gonna go hide in the bathroom where it's safe.
Dana, I know. I'll run off to check an obscure noise in the kitchen!
Heather, I'm gonna slowly walk backwards into a dimly lit room.
Candace," Really? See, if they watch more domestic horror films, they'd know..."
Lacie, (groans offscreen)
Vanessa, Lacie? Are you okay? (walks up to the bathroom door)
Lacie, Oh. Yeah.
Vanessa, Feeling safer in there?
Lacie, (stoic) L-Lots.
Vanessa, Cool.
Candace, Wait a minute.
Doof zombies," Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
Candace, (gasps)
Lacie, (gets transformed) Lots of...
Doof zombie (Lacie), ...me...
Candace and Vanessa, Run!
Dana," Oh, I knew we shouldn't have split up!"
Doof zombie, (touching them) Lots of me...
Punk girls, (gasping)
Dana, Aaiiiiieeee!
Doof zombies (Punk girls), Lots of me...
Doof zombies," Lots of me...,etc."
Giant Floating Doofy Zombie Head (Giant Floating Baby Head), Lots of me...
Gretchen," Katie, bar the door. (Katie does so) Is she back yet?"
Holly, No sign of her. We've searched everywhere.
Milly, Where could she be?
Gretchen, She's probably still with Phineas and Ferb. She'll make it.
Adyson, Perimeter alert! We have incoming.
Gretchen," Stations, everyone! (to Ginger) Put out that light. (Ginger does so) Katie?"
Katie, Yup. (turns to the door) Friend or pharmacist?
Phineas," (behind door) It's us, let us in! (Katie opens the door; Phineas, Ferb, Baljeet and Buford enter)"
Adyson, It's Phineas and Ferb!
Ginger, And Baljeet.
Phineas," Isabella, are you here?"
Gretchen, (gasps) We thought she was with you.
Adyson, Isabella's still out there?
Buford," I toldja, man! She's probably wearin' a lab coat by now!"
Phineas, It can't be!
Baljeet," I am afraid Buford is right, Phineas."
Doof zombie, Lots of me... (chatters teeth like Perry)
Baljeet, The odds of anyone surviving out there for this long—
Phineas," If anyone can do it, Isabella can!"
Buford," It doesn't matter anyway! Sooner or later, they're gonna figure out we're in here and then they're gonna come in here! They're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in here and they're gonna—"
Gretchen," (slaps Buford) Lock it down, solider! No one is gonna get in here, ya hear me?!"
Buford, I am so in love with her right now.
Phineas," Okay, I'm running out of ideas. I don't know where she could be."
Isabella, I'm right here.
Phineas, Isabella! I'm so sorry we lost track of you.
Isabella, There's no time! We have a job to do!
"Adyson, Ginger and Gretchen", (infatuated) OooooOOOooooh!
Isabella," We may be the only non-pharmacists left in Danville. I think I figured out where this started. And if we could get there, we might be able to figure out how it started and reverse it."
Phineas, Wait. How did you find out where it started?
Isabella," (uncapping a marker) Well, I'm glad you asked."
Isabella," ♪ Roger Doofenshmirtz, we know, is six feet and two inches tall ♪"
Fireside Girls, ♪ Triangulation! ♪
Isabella, ♪ That's how I figured it out. ♪
Fireside Girls, ♪ Triangulation! ♪
Isabella, ♪ Now I'm left with no doubt. ♪
Isabella and the Fireside Girls, ♪ That could pinpoint the conclusion of my scientific quest. ♪
Baljeet, ♪ Cha cha cha! ♪ That is a mighty upbeat song for a desperate situation.
Phineas," Huh, that building looks familiar."
Phineas," Oh. I guess that's why. Y'know, it might be a good idea to board that window."
Katie, Oh! So that's why there was so much wood left over.
Doof zombie, Lots of me... Lots of me...
Katie, And I definitely should have closed the window! (gets grabbed by the other Fireside Girls) Eeee!
Phineas, Now what?
Isabella, We've gotta make our way to that building! I'm sure we'll find our answers there!
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Gretchen, Where're they going?
Isabella, Doesn't matter. They're distracted. Let's move!
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Doof Zombie (Pinky the Chihuahua), (growls)
Candace, In here!
Vanessa, Ugh!
Candace, Phew!
Candace, What's going on with your dad?
Vanessa, I don't know. His schemes aren't normally this successful.
Candace, Wait! Phineas and Ferb!
Vanessa, I'm pretty sure this was not them.
Candace," No, I know. But they'll know what to do about it. (banging on the door) Come on! Come on! Let's move!"
Vanessa, I'm right behind ya!
Doof zombies," Lots of me...,etc."
Isabella, We made it!
Buford," Not a pharmacist in sight. Now's as good a time as any to rush in blindly, don't you think?"
Phineas," Okay, guys. Let's go...quietly."
Doof zombies," Lots of me...,etc."
Isabella, Here they come!
Baljeet, They are all over the place!
Phineas, Come on! Let's go!
Baljeet, (screams)
Buford, Sanctuary!
Isabella, (gasps)
Doof zombie (Gretchen), Lots of me...
Isabella, No! No!
Isabella,Act VI
Isabella, I'm going back for them!
Phineas, You can't help them now!
Phineas and Isabella, (scream)
Phineas, Quick! Find something to block this door!
Buford, It ain't gonna be easy without ruinin' the feng shui of the lobby.
Phineas, Hurry! (A zombie rips his sleeve.) I'm exposed!
Isabella," Phineas, use this! (Tosses the Emotional Bravery Patch to him.)"
Phineas, (catches the patch) Thanks! (He covers the rip with the patch.)
Phineas," Nice work, bro! Thanks, Isabella! Are you all right?"
Isabella, I'm all right.
Phineas," Buford, you okay?"
Buford, I'm okay? (to Baljeet) You okay?
Baljeet, I am fine.
Doof zombie, Lots of me...
Baljeet, (gasps and screams as he transforms)
Buford, BALJEET!!!!
Baljeet, Lots of...
Doof zombie (Baljeet), ...me...
Buford, (takes off his clown mask) That's it!
Phineas," Buford, what are you doing?"
Buford," Look, I just lost my nerd! I'm not gonna lose the rest of my friends, too! (takes off his rubber duckies)"
Phineas," But, Buford, that's—"
Buford," (stripping down to his underdrawers) Come on, you freaks! Fresh meat! (screams) Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks! Yippee-ki—"
Buford, (offscreen) Lots of...
Doof zombie (Buford), ...me...
Phineas," Y'know, he really could've been bait without taking his clothes off."
Isabella," Uh, yeah."
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Doof zombie (Agent B), (Growls)
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, need a ride? (a rope ladder drops down from the chopper) Oh, oh, oh, wait, I should've said, ""Need a lift?"" That's what— I totally missed it."
Doofenshmirtz," It's much safer up here, huh? You might still wanna buckle up, though. It's my first time flying a helicopter."
Phineas, That'll hold for now. But we gotta move before—
Phineas," Really?! Come on, guys! Head for the stairs!"
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas, (attempts to open the stairway door) It's locked!
Isabella, Now what?!
Phineas, Any ideas?
Isabella, I got nothin'!
Phineas, Ferb?
Ferb, I'm petrified beyond all capacity for rational thought.
Phineas, Candace?
Candace, Phineas!
Isabella, Candace!
Candace, Isabella?
Vanessa, Ferb!
Ferb, (no comment)
Phineas, Candace!
Candace, Phineas!
Isabella, Candace!
Candace, Isabella?
Vanessa, Ferb!
Ferb, (no comment)
Phineas, Candace!
Candace, Phineas!
Isabella, Enough! We have to get upstairs!
Candace, No way! The whole upstairs is crawling with ph—
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Candace, Stairwell it is! What's with the rubber?
Phineas, It insulates against the infection.
Candace, I don't even wanna know how you figured that one out.
Stacy," No! Don't walk into the kitchen, Grievance lady! Ohhh! Gosh! How could she be so oblivious?"
Phineas, Just...keep...climbing...
Candace, (panting) This is enough cardi...cardio...to last me a lifetime.
Doofenshmirtz," Man, I've had off days before, but this is a lulu, even for me. I-I never thought I could get so sick of myself. Oh, well. You know, at least with a disaster of this proportion, things can't get any worse."
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, Perry the Platypus, when you get a minute, grab the controls, would you-"
Vanessa," This is it, my dad's floor."
Candace, Thank goodness.
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Vanessa," Whoa, this place is crawling with them."
Isabella, (pointing to the destroyed inator) There it is! That must be where the ray came from!
Candace, Ugh! If only there was a way to get rid of all those zombies.
Doof zombies, Lots of...
Vanessa, Strange and unusual.
Candace, Same old same old. Come on!
Doofenshmirtz," (coughs) Oh, I sure hope the poor slob who lives here has insurance. That would be... (He looks around to see he is ""the poor slob who lives here"".) Oh, crud. Vanessa!"
Vanessa," Dad! (runs up to him for a hug) It's you! Okay, so what did you do?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, it was just a simple Repulse-inator, y'know to, to make Roger ugly, but then, there was some sort of power surge and this happened!"
Phineas," (tinkering with the inator) Well, that explains the electromagnetic charge that's changing everybody. But we need some kind of conductor that neutralizes it."
Isabella," Well, water neutralizes static."
Phineas, Yes! Water should change everyone back!
Vanessa," Um, isn't that a bit of a leap?"
Doofenshmirtz," No, I'm a scientist. I'm gonna go with 'im on that. I might have a water pistol lying around. I-I can go get it."
Phineas," Yeah, but we've gotta find a way to get everyone in Danville wet at once. Otherwise, the contagion could start again."
Isabella, We can wait till it rains.
Candace, Oh! We don't have time! And when does it ever rain here?
Phineas," Unfortunately, the water went out with the power. So we need to find a large supplier of water. Preferably elevated so that gravity can work in our favor."
Phineas," Yeah, I know. We just need to build a pulley system to get us over there and some sort of giant sprinkler to spray the whole city."
Vanessa, There's always lots of spare parts laying around here.
Doofenshmirtz, I like to tinker.
Phineas, Let's get to work!
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, fellas, I think you might wanna hurry up."
Phineas, You guys hold 'em off! And don't forget to rubber up!
Doofenshmirtz, (doing a karate yell and wearing rubber gloves on his arms and head)
Vanessa," Dad, why are you wearing that? Aren't you immune?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, everyone else was dressing up."
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas," That's it! Everything's built! Let's go over the plan. (They take out scale models.) One: Ferb shoots the grappling hook, which attaches to the service platform of the water tower. Two: We send the vortex sprayer up the line. Three: We all ride up in the basket lift. Four: Once we reach the tower, I'll climb into the top of the tank..."
Candace, Talk faster!
Phineas," ...and open the hatch. Five: Isabella will attach the connecting claw to the open hatch, which will move the vortex sprayer into place."
Vanessa," (offscreen) Phineas, we can't hold them much longer!"
Phineas," Whoever makes it to the vortex sprayer first presses that button to activate it! (Breathes) Alright, any questions?"
Candace," Yeah, was it worth the time it took to build a scale model?"
Phineas," Totally. Anyone else? Yeah, you in the back?"
Doof zombie, Lots of me...
Vanessa," Hurry up, guys!"
Vanessa," Great shot, Ferb!"
Candace," Vanessa, behind you! (gets touched and transforms) Oh, crud. Lots of..."
Doof zombie (Candace), ...me...
Phineas, Candace!
Doof zombie (Candace), Lots of me...
Phineas, NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Isabella," Come on, guys! We gotta go!"
Phineas, Hurry!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, man, what I wouldn't give for that single-minded focus. Hey, what's that over there?"
Doof zombie (Perry), (chatters) Lots of me...
Doofenshmirtz, No! Not Perry the Platypus!!
Vanessa, There's too many of them! Dad?! (gets touched and transforms)
Doofenshmirtz, No! Not Vanessa!!!
Doof zombie (Vanessa), Lots of me?
Doofenshmirtz," NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! (takes off his gloves) That's it! That's it! That's it! (takes off his lab coat and shirt) I've had enough of you mes! (Doof is now in his underdrawers.) Alright, you freaks! Fresh meat! Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks! Yippee-ki-yay!"
Phineas, Again with the clothes.
Isabella, I know. What's that all about?
Doofenshmirtz, (offscreen) This is yet another callback to something I didn't hear!
Isabella, Wow! Look at that! We may be the only ones left.
Isabella, Oh no! The line's breaking! We're not gonna make it!
Phineas," We have to! If we don't make it, Danville falls!"
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas, Is everyone all right?
Isabella, I'm good!
Phineas," And there's the vortex sprayer! C'mon, let's go!"
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Phineas, We're not gonna make it!
Ferb, No. You and Isabella will make it. (He charges into the zombies.)
Phineas, Ferb! No!
Ferb, (grunts)
Phineas and Isabella, Ferb!
Doof zombie (Ferb), Lots of me...
Isabella, Phineas! No! Don't touch him!
Phineas, Ferb! I can't just...
Isabella, I know! But the only way to save him is to keep going! Come on!
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Isabella, Phineas! Aaah!
Phineas," Hang in there, Isabella! We're almost there!"
Isabella," It's just...If this is the end, there's something I have to tell you!"
Phineas," Okay, shoot."
Isabella, For the longest time...
Phineas, C'mon! There it is!
Isabella," But, Phineas, Phineas... I LIKE YOU!!"
Phineas," I like you, too, Isabella!"
Isabella, No! I mean I like-you like you!
Phineas," Wow. I mean, gosh. I...I...I've always felt..."
Isabella, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Phineas, Get away from her!
Isabella, Phineas! No! Ah! No!
Phineas, (Grunting)
Doof zombie (Phineas), Lots of me...
Isabella," Oh, Phineas! (sniffles) Get it together, Fireside Girl! It's up to you to save Phineas! (climbs up the tower) It's up to you to save Danville! It's up to you... (Realizes what she is doing) to stop talking to yourself!"
Isabella, Aaah! (grunting) Got...to...Go! (She presses the button successfully but still transforms and grunts) Lots of...
Doof zombie (Isabella), ...me...
Roger, Is the ceremony over?
Doof zombies, Lots of...
Major Monogram," Carl, why are we holding our arms like this?"
Doof zombies, Lots of me...
Buford, I dunno what happened here and I'm pretty sure I don't want to.
Doof zombies, Lots of me...
Shaun, I still say this makes no sense at all.
Ed," I know, right?"
Vanessa," Oh, hey there, Candace. You okay?"
Candace," Oh, yeah, totes. Just hangin' out, rockin' the wet lo— Oh, who'm I kidding? Look at me."
Vanessa," Well, you're pretty cool under pressure."
Candace, You weren't so bad yourself.
Vanessa, Thanks. It was good hanging with you. We should do it again sometime. Preferably without the threat of a zombie apocalypse.
Doofenshmirtz, I'm not makin' any promises.
Candace," Well, see you around. (she leaves)"
Vanessa," Definitely. Come on, Dad. Let's go play a game of Kleptocracy."
Doofenshmirtz, That's my girl.
Phineas, Isabella. Are you okay?
Isabella, Yeah. Just a little foggy.
Phineas, What happened?
Isabella," I remember building the vortex sprayer, but after that, I've got no clue."
Phineas," Me neither. But whatever happened, it worked!"
Ferb, Yes. Everyone seems to be noticeably lab coat free.
Phineas, At least everyone within the walled city of Danville.
Isabella," (offscreen) Yeah, too bad about the rest of civilization."
Doof zombies," Lots of me..., etc."
Title Card, The End
Stacy," Pfft! Horror movies. Scary, but so unbelievable. (She leaves.)"
