Milly, The opening ceremony of the Bee Day festival was awesome!
Holly, It's my favorite part of Bee Awareness Day!
Katie, My favorite part is the B-flat with the F-sharp bass at the end of the song! (They all look at her.) What? It's tradition!
Isabella," Okay, girls, festivities are over. Let's focus on getting our beekeeping patches. It's the only patch that we've ever tried to get and failed. Remember last year?"
Gretchen, (Interrupting Isabella's flashback) Eep! You promised to never flashback on that ever again.
Isabella," Right, right! You're right. (Walks outside to a yard with a bee hive in the middle.) But still, if we don't succeed today, the two strikes and you're out rule kicks in, which means this spot will stay empty on our sashes forever! (Close up on her sash showing an outlined mark, she gasps and sniffles)"
Gretchen," Chill out, Isabella. We've got this. Ready, girls? (She pulls off the top of the hive)"
Fireside Girls, (Gasp) They're gone!
Isabella," Gone? F-f-f-fighting flashforward to potential catastrophe! (Screen ripples, record scratches) Hey, where's Pinky?"
Admiral Acronym," Good afternoon, Agent Pinky. I see you've taken our new handbag conveyor system. (Pinky growls) Carla here has intelled that Poofenplotz has been hatching some sort of bee-related evil scheme. Carla?"
Carla," Yes, it seems that Poofenplotz is researching the use of royal jelly in the bee community. (Beeping) Oh, there's your coffee."
Admiral Acronym," Isn't she a find? She comes from an entire family of unpaid interns. Anyways, see if there is anything to Carla's research, Agent Pinky. Admiral Acronym out."
Isabella, (shrieks) We've gotta find those bees before the sun goes down! But how?
Gretchen," In the guideline for the beekeeping patch, it says that a good beekeeper tries to think like a bee."
Katie, Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
Gretchen, What are you doing?
Katie, I'm thinking like a bee!
Adyson, I know! We can get stung by radioactive bees and gain bee-themed superpowers!
Holly, Um...we don't have access to radioactive bees.
Ginger, (sarcastically) Yeah. That's what's wrong with that plan.
Isabella, But we do have access to Phineas and Ferb. And they have access to a sorbet machine that turned Candace into a fly. They've gotta be able to modify it to turn people into bees.
Katie, Phineas and Ferb have a sorbet machine that turns people into flies?
Isabella," Katie, for crying out loud, look it up on the Internet!"
Poofenplotz, Let's see.
Poofenplotz," Bill, bill, flyer... (gasps and squeals) This must be my acceptance letter into L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! Oh! (she tears the envelope open and takes out the letter and reads it) ""Dear Esmeralda Poofenplotz..."" Oh, that sounds promising!"
Poofenplotz,"We regret to [inform] you that your application for membership has been denied. Based on your past schemes, we have deemed that you're not even close to our standard for admission."
Poofenplotz,"Feel free to re-apply after you've come up with something really evil. At the very least, get yourself a decent lab coat."
Poofenplotz,"Sincerely,"
Poofenplotz,"Heinz Doofenshmirtz"".)"
Poofenplotz," ""We regret to inform you that..."" Oh! Reject me, will they? No matter. (she crumples the paper up) My newest evil scheme is sure to catch the attention of that silly boy's club. (Close up on Pinky in his purse. He barks.) Pinky the Chihuahua! (Pinky jumps out of the purse and growls and barks at his adversary.) Fortunately, I was expecting you. (She pushes a button on a remote and a makeup case pops out of the rug trapping Pinky.) The makeup case doubles as as a trap. (She lifts it up.) Could you hand me that lipstick in there? (Pinky gives her the lipstick.) Thank you."
Phineas," What are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony?"
Isabella, Of course! Wouldn't miss it!
Phineas," See ya later, then!"
Baljeet, Did you know that bees can communicate with each other through dancing?
Ginger, That's really interesting!
Baljeet, Yes. They do a tail-wagging dance to alert each other to a source of food. (in background) The waggle explains the angle to the destination in relations to the imaginary line between the sun and the door of the hive.
Isabella," Okay, let's see...setting, targets... (she types in the control panel) ""Fireside Girls..."" And that should do it. (She presses a red button.) Here we go."
Baljeet," (looks away from Ginger) In a minute. (Turns around) So to continue, the figure eight and... (Notices Ginger has disappeared) Awwww, annnnnd we are back."
Isabella," Fireside Bees, follow your noses!"
Fireside Bees, (sniffing) That way!
Poofenplotz," Mmmmwah. Much better. Now that my lips are taken care of, I can tell you about my beautifully evil plan. (Pinky growls, and Poofenplotz sprays him with a water bottle.) Bad doggie! Okay, sit! (Pinky sits) That's better. Now pay attention as the camera slowly moves closer and we cross-dissolve to my thoughts."
Poofenplotz," (voiceover) Behold, a humble beehive. A massively warded society just like our own. Observe a young grub bee fed mass quantities of royal jelly, which will make her larger and eventually she will become queen. So logic dictates that if I were to consume massive amounts of royal jelly, then I would grow four times bigger and live four times longer and eventually be crowned Queen of the World! The Queen!"
Poofenplotz," And I shall not be dark, but beautiful, like the night in the day, and all shall love me and despair!"
Poofenplotz," (voiceover) And I might have a grotesquely large abdomen for laying eggs, but I can live with that."
Poofenplotz," Come, Pinky the Chihuahua! To the Myselfcopter! (She laughs taking Pinky with her climbing into a helicopter shaped in her own image as she flies off)"
Isabella, My bee instincts are buzzing! This must be where our bees went!
Gretchen, They must've been attracted to that heavenly scent. What is that?
Doofenshmirtz," (talking under) Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. 'Cause you see, it's a-it's a real vacuum cleaner."
Milly, It seems to be coming from that gigantic perfume sprayer.
Gretchen, Let's check it out!
Isabella," Woah! It looks like every bee in Danville is here! Fireside Girls, forward, buzz!"
Doofenshmirtz, (He activates the vacuum and all the bees get sucked inside) Ha ha! Sucks to bee you!
Doofenshmirtz, ...just shut off this baby—Oops! I almost hit the...
Doofenshmirtz, (from outside) ...self-destruct button here!
Isabella," Wow! Humans really take for granted not being sucked into the nearest vacuum cleaner. I'm gonna see if the queen knows anything. (She buzzes up to the queen bee) Excuse me, Your Majesty, do you have any idea how to get out?"
Queen Bee," Not a clue. And without my jelly, I'm way too weak to fly. Ugh."
Isabella," Whadaya think, Fireside Girls?"
Holly, What are we supposed to do now?
Gretchen, Bee Day's almost over and we're stuck inside a pharmacist's power-vac.
Isabella," What? Over? Did you say ""over""? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when we helped Candace get fifty patches in one day? Heck no!"
Holly, I thought it was only forty-nine.
Ginger," Forget it, she's rolling."
Isabella," And it's not over now! Cause when the going gets tough... the tough get going! Come on, girls, we've got enough patches between all of us to make this work! We can do this! Gretchen, Milly, Katie, you've got the exploring patch, right?"
Milly," Yes, and we can look for a way back out of here!"
"Gretchen, Milly and Katie", Right!
Isabella," (picking up a piece of hair) These pieces of hair and dust are like rope! Holly, Ginger, you girls have the advanced knot-tying patch. What do you think?"
Holly, We could totally work with that stuff!
Ginger, And make a sling for the queen!
Isabella," And Adyson, you and I have the appliance repair patch!"
Adyson, Let's hotwire the vacuum and reverse the motor so that it blows us all out again!
Isabella, (fist bumping Adyson) That's what I'm talkin' about!
Adyson, There they are! All we need to do is swap those leads to the forward-reverse switch.
Isabella, Great! How's that sling comin'?
"Gretchen, Milly and Katie", All good to go!
Isabella," Excellent work! Recon Team, is the escape path charted?"
Ginger and Holly," Yes, ma'am! Power vac hose located!"
Holly, Achoo! It was murder on my allergies.
Isabella," Bee-youtiful! Prepare for exit, everyone!"
Doofenshmirtz, Uh-oh! (All the bees surround Doofenshmirtz) Ah!
Isabella," Great job, Adyson."
Adyson," Uh, thanks?"
Isabella," We're going home to the Fireside Lodge! Everybody, follow me!"
Isabella, Oh! It's wearing off!! (screams)
Isabella, Come on! We're almost there!
Isabella, Yay! The bees are back! Now we just need to get them back into their hives.
Milly," Okay, little bees, go back into your hive."
Holly, We don't speak their language anymore. We can't communicate.
Katie, Ooh! I have my semaphore patch! Would that work?
Adyson, Only if they were on a boat.
Ginger, Baljeet is the answer.
Isabella," Ginger, now really isn't the time t—"
Ginger, No no no! He told me all about this dance they do to alert each other to a source of food or shelter.
Gretchen, Like the rhumba?
Ginger," No, it's a waggle dance!"
Isabella, Dance patches we've got!

Ginger," ♪ Well, I don't think I can really overstate it, ♪"
Fireside Girls, ♪ Is packed with meaning when their butts gyrate! ♪
Ginger," ♪ See, the waggle explains the angle ♪"
Gretchen," Oh, 75 degrees is the angle in relationship to the sun."
Ginger," Yeah, but it also tells the bees the distance they're gonna have to go just to get there!"
Gretchen, Ooh...
Fireside Girls," ♪ It's a waggle dance, waggle dance, ♪"
Ginger, Let's do it!
Fireside Girls, ♪ Figure eight and shake it again! ♪

Poofenplotz," Ah, my locatificator has led me to the motherlode! The royal jelly room at the Moist Beauty Works factory! It won't be long now, Agent Pinky. Soon I'll be able to carry out my most beautifully evil plan yet! (she laughs again. Shot of a nervous Pinky from inside the makeup case. He sees a loose thread and pulls it making the bag come apart. Pinky pushes Poofenplotz making the myselfcopter crash land.) Bad doggy! Bad bad doggy! Oof! (Shot from inside the factory. Poofenplotz is flat on her face.) Ooh. That's the last time I buy a cheap designer knockoff trap from downtown. (gasps) I don't believe it! Fortune is smiling upon me like the creepy guy on the corner of 3rd and Main! (She gets up) We're in the royal jelly chamber of the Moist Beauty organic cosmetics factory! Ha ha ha! How unbelievably coincidental. No really, I mean, I couldn't have asked for a better place to crash. Anyway, you have failed, Pinky the Chihuahua, and brought me right to the biggest supply of royal jelly in the Tri-State Area! (She laughs evilly again as Pinky kicks her into the chambers, which pours royal jelly all over her) I....can't move. Well, I...I'm not much larger and I'm not really feeling royal at all. I suppose my plan was predicated on a faulty hypothesis now, wasn't it? I guess there's only one thing to say, and that's: Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua!!"
Poofenplotz," Ooh, how humiliating. Piloted off to the pokey by a pooch."
Isabella, (giving one to Milly) Here's your patch and here's my patch! Yay! Time to paaaarrr-tay!
Isabella," Sorry we're late, Phineas. Our bee ceremony ran long."
Phineas," No worries, Isabella. Go ahead and join Mom in the fun."
Isabella," Come on, girls! Let's hit the pool!"
Linda," Aw, it's just like old times."
Phineas," Hey, Isabella, we're having iced tea! You want some, honey?"
Isabella, What did you say?
Phineas," I said, ""We're having iced tea! (taking out a honey bear tube and a spoon) You want some honey?"""
Isabella," Oh, um, heh-heh, sure!"
