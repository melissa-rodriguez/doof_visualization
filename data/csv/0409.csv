Meap," (in a hunky accent) It was good getting down around town with my main man, Phineas and Ferb."
Phineas," I think those translation sideburns are really working for you, Meap."
Meap, Rock n' roll! (takes sideburns off) Meap!
Phineas," Later, Meap!"
Isabella," Hey Phineas, what'cha doin'?"
Phineas," Oh, you missed it. We were just talking with Meap in the galactic web."
Baljeet, What is that flashing on your screen?
Phineas," Hmm...I don't know. Let's open it up, Ferb."
Morg," Hi, my name is Morg. Have you ever wished that you could pop off to another planet, on the other side of the galaxy for a quick visit? Well, now you can! With Mind Share Vacations! Mmm! You and your friends can trade places, with me and my friends, for the interplanetary vacation, of a lifetime!"
Phineas, That sounds like fun.
Morg," Imagine, relaxing in a hot rock by the pools, and then surrounded by beautiful newts! Or splork through the tubeworm forest, of put wishum foomf! Woohoo! Hmm! Here's how it works. Your mind comes to lodge in his head, and his mind goes to stay in yours. Only your mind makes the trip, mmm. All you have to do, is build this highly sophisticated device, and be on your way to priiiii...a mind share vacation of a lifetime!"
Phineas," Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today."
Baljeet, It sounded like he almost said we were on our way to Perry.
Buford," Ha ha ha. Hey, where is Perry?"
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P. We have intelligence that Doofenshmirtz may have taken up Square Dancing. He cannot be allowed to use one of our beloved American traditions for his evil purposes! So get out there and make sure he do-si-do...sen't do that, I guess."
Phineas," There, finished. Well, that was easier than I thought. Let's fire this bad boy up!"
Phineas," Brace yourselves for fun, because we're going on a Mind Share Vacation!"
Baljeet, Did it work?
Phineas, I think it did.
Buford," Hey, wait a second. (Ferb rolls the backdrop up) Where the heck are we?"
Baljeet," Ohhhh, prison. We were on our way to prison."
Isabella, That's what he almost said.
Morg," Hmm! Our escape plan worked perfectly! We are now free to ransack this planet! Everyone, celebration noises!"
Morg," Okay, that's enough!"
Ferb, It appears as though we've been transported into some sort of...inter-galactic hoosegow.
Buford, I was framed!
Phineas, (holding a sauce can) I'm afraid we've been duped into aiding in the escape of some rather brilliant galactic prisoners. And they did it with this little gadget --
Isabella," Phineas, that's you!"
Morg," That's right losers, mmm! We pulled the old switcheroo! In case you chumps have any ideas about coming back, we're setting the device on our end to self-destruct! In one hour!"
Alien in Buford's body, Why are we waiting an hour to destroy it?
Alien in Baljeet's body, Have you no sense of drama?
Morg," Sayonara, suckers! Mmm!"
Buford, Ain't that the squirts.
Isabella," Well, look on the bright side! (pause) I got nothing."
Buford," Hey, guys, I just realized somethin'! I'm the only fly in a prison full of frogs and lizards!"
Baljeet, Luckily I do not think anyone else has noticed.
Inmate 1," (offscreen) You're mine, flyboy!"
Inmate 2, (offscreen) Fresh fly!
Inmate 3, (offscreen) We're gonna get you!
Baljeet," Well, it was nice knowing you."
Phineas," I think I figured out how we can reverse this thing. We'll be back in our own bodies in no time, barring any unforeseen— (alarm blares) What's that?"
Warden," Out of your cells, ladies! Surprise inspection! Cell number 12, don't make me come down there! Morg! What are you and your misfits up to this time? What's that? (pointing to the device in the cell)"
Phineas," Oh, uh—"
Warden, Contraband! One more infraction outta you nerds and I will put you all in the hole for good!!! You got it?!!
Isabella, The guard just took our only connection back to Earth! Now what are we gonna do?!
Phineas," I think we might be able to rebuild it, if we could just get the parts."
Buford, We need to find a guy who knows how to get things. Every prison has one.
Baljeet, How do you know what every prison ha—
Buford, Uh-uh!! Don't go there!
Candace, Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah! Where on earth do you think you're going?
Morg, We're going to Lotsmo to steal food.
Candace, What?! Are you pretending to be aliens or something?
Morg," Hmm, yes, pretending. Hilarity noises! (The aliens laugh and the alien in Baljeet's body honks repeatedly again) I'm not gonna tell you again! (The alien briefly stops but not before honking one last time, much to the irritation of Morg)"
Doofenshmirtz," Gotcha! Ha-ha! I know what you're thinking. Why the snazzy getup? Why the boots? Well, ya see, I met this girl, Rosie, on a square-dancing website and I may have led her to believe that I'm...an expert square dancer. (Perry looks at him scornfully) Hey, don't give me that self-righteous look! It's the web, man! Everybody stretches the truth! You don't think that cat really eats cheeseburgers, do you? Anyway, that's why I made these boots (close-up on the boots) to help me dance. See? They have these little microphones that hear all the commands of the square dance caller and they move exactly to those commands, making me the perfect square dancer! So I really want to make a good impression. Maybe you can come along and, you know, make me look good. What do you say? Will you be my wingman? (Perry just gives Doof a look) There's my guy! Oh, yeah, and by the way, she also thinks I'm a champion bull rider, so if it comes up, you, y-, h-hey, don't look at me like that!"
Red," (voiceover) There must be a guy like me in every prison in the universe. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. Dragonflies, a warm rock if that's your thing, or maybe a lilly-pad for your kid's graduation. So when Morg and his friends needed parts for a mind-swap device, (Buford and Baljeet approach the creature with a piece of paper) they came looking for me."
Buford," Psst, I understand you're a guy that knows how to get things."
Baljeet, Stop it! Stop it! What is wrong with you?! Spit him out!
Red, I'm sorry. I skipped breakfast. What is it you are looking for?
Buford, (gives him the piece of paper) Here. We made a list.
Red, (taking out a pair of reading glasses) You can find everything you need in the dumpster out back of the Lotsmo on Flyway 61.
Buford, So then you can get us the stuff?
Red, No. I'm not the guy who gets things. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. You would have to tunnel out of your cell and crawl 500 yards through the prison gunge pipe just to reach the outside. That's the length of five football fields.
Buford, How d'ya know how long a football field is?
Red," (voiceover) Later that day, to make their escape, those boys crawled through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness I can't even imagine. (Fade on a shot of a sewer pipe. Phineas crawls out of it into the sewage. He lifts his arms up just like Tim Robbins did in the movie.) Five hundred yards. That's the length of 11 baseball banners, one tennis court, a medium-sized male elephant and a croquet wicket. (While Red is narrating, Ferb crawls out, followed by Isabella. Fade in on a shot of the gang at the dumpster holding some spare parts.) It wasn't long before they found everything that they needed."
Phineas, Great! Let's hurry up and put this thing together!
Isabella," The sooner, the better!"
Baljeet," But if we do the mind swap here, those criminals will still be out of jail."
Phineas, You're right. I hadn't thought of that.
Red," (voiceover) So even later that day, those boys crawled back through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness that I—"
Baljeet," Actually, it is not as bad as you would think."
Buford," Yeah, gunge is actually quite refreshing."
Red," (voiceover) Oh. Well, it was still 500 yards. That's the length of two volleyball courts, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, a large three-drawer filing cabinet, three French—"
Buford, (from inside the pipe) We're not listening anymore!
Red," (voiceover) Oh. Okay, then."
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, check it out, Perry the Platypus. There she is. That's Rosie. (cut to a woman with light red hair and freckles wearing a magenta dress holding a red Solo cup) She's from Hazel Park (whispering) by the racetrack. (out loud) Why don't you go over there and sit with the other wingmen? (cut to outside a barn where three airplane wingmen are sitting and giving thumbs up) And you can, you know, give me hand signals in case I get stuck. Right? (He approaches Rosie) Heh, hi there. I'm...I'm JohnnyRingoenshmirtz217."
Rosie," (in a southern accent) Oh, so nice to finally meet you face to face. I must say, I like a man with a strong chin."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, (chuckles) well, thank you. A lot of people focus on the, you know, the weak forehead. So you...so you care to dance?"
Rosie, I would love to.
Caller, ♪ Do-si-do with all your might ♪
Caller,Pick it up now!
Rosie," Well, Johnny, I'm impressed."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, these boots were made for dancin'... (closeup on the boots) literally."
Phineas, Hello? Earth?
Phineas, Hello?
Candace," (turns around and screams) Why are you talking like my little brother, lizard boy?!"
Phineas," It's me, Candace, Phineas! Outer space alien super crooks from a land of frogs and reptiles have taken over our bodies."
Candace, Okay. What do you want me to do?
Phineas, Really? You believe that weird story just like that?
Candace," Yeah, it's been a long summer, kid. What do you need?"
Phineas," Well, okay. We need you to find those aliens that look like us and get them to stand on the mind share machine staging area over there."
Candace, The what?
Phineas," Y'know, that platform thing. It's the only way to get our brains back into our bodies."
Candace, Okay.
Phineas," Oh, the machine is set to self-destruct in one hour (Candace puts her hands over her mouth in disbelief) so you gotta hurry."
Candace," Right! I'm on it, Phineas! (she exits to the left side of the screen)"
Morg," (offscreen) Mmmm, quickly now! Get all that gluten on the transport vehicle!"
Morg, (offscreen) Hmm...let's go! I've seen Argonian moon sloths that move faster!
Caller, (in the distance) ♪ Now join hands with the lady fair ♪
Caller,Pick it up now!
Morg, Hmm...what is that? That sound? (Their eyes literally widen) I feel compelled to obey its hypnotic quadrilateral voice commands! Hmm...must seek out source!
Candace, Where are they going now?
Rosie, You got me all tuckered out with that fancy footwork you been doin'. What should we do now?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, well, let's see. (Looks to Perry who rubs his belly) We could rub our stomachs (Perry opens his mouth and points to inside of it) and point to our mouths and later we could roll our eyes and put our head in our hands."
Rosie, I thought we could get somethin' to eat.
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, that sounds good, too. I mean... Hang on, let me check. (Perry gives him a thumbs up) Let's go!"
Morg," Oh, rhinestone encrusted oracle, command us with your quadrilateral right angle voice commands! Hmm..."
Caller," ♪ Allemande with the old left hand, ♪"
Candace, Of course.

Candace," ♪ Listen up, dweebs, and listen good! ♪"
Candace,That's right! Cross on through there! (She beckons for the band to follow her as she leaves the dance)
Warden," Out of your cells, ladies! Inspection time!"
Phineas," Oh, Candace better hurry up!"
Candace," ♪ I'm gonna get my brothers back, ♪"
Warden," Number 12, front and center! Number twelve!"
Candace," Oh, what did he call it? The-the transfer stage arena? The...mind swap place? The...the, um..."
Phineas," Come on, Candace! Hurry!"
Candace," Oh, I remember!"
Warden," What have you got to say for yourself this time, Morg?!"
Morg, We were framed! Hmmm..
Phineas," Candace, you did it!"
Candace," That's right, and when Mom gets back you're gonna be so --"
Phineas, And just in the nick of time!
Candace," Oh, never mind."
