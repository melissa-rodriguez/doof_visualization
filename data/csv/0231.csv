Baljeet, Do you find it as curious as I do that your menu has not changed since you opened in 1929?
Jeremy," I know! It's awesome, right? It's our motto: Slushy Dawgs never get any better."
Baljeet," In that case, I will have--"
Buford," (pushes Baljeet out of the way) Step aside, weenie! One Windmill Corn Dog, hold the bun."
Jeremy, (produces Buford's order) Excellent choice.
Buford, You saved my life.
Baljeet, It was nothing. (notices Buford bowing to Baljeet's feet) What are you doing?
Buford, I am now your humble servant.
Baljeet, What?
Buford, It's part of the Bully Code. (produces a card and gives it to Baljeet)
Baljeet," ""If a nerd shood save a bully's life, the bully becomes the nerd's slave for life."" ""Should"" is misspelled."
Buford," It was written by bullies, duh!"
Baljeet," Well, that is very kind of you, but I do not want a slave."
Buford," Too bad, you got one."
Baljeet, I think I will be going now. (departs)
Buford," I will clear my mind of everything, except for Baljeet. (stares at the ceiling for a moment) There, that was easy."
Baljeet, (walking along the streets of Danville) You are following me.
Buford," At a respectable distance, little master."
Candace," (from inside) So, what do you think?"
Stacy," Uh, what am I looking at?"
Candace," Duh, it's a new red shirt!"
Candace," It's Jeremy! He sent me a picture. (looks at picture) Aw, look at his cute, little wiener hat. Let's send him a picture of me. How do I look? Check the lighting. (Stacy takes the picture) I don't want to-- Wait, you took it while I was still talking! Let me see that. (shows an ugly Candace) Ugh, I'd better erase that. (pushes button)"
Phone, Picture sent.
Candace," Oh, no! I hit the wrong button!"
Candace,"Stacy Uh, go into the menu and--"
Phone, Picture sent.
Candace," Oh, no! I did it again!"
Stacy, Let me see. (accidentally takes multiple pictures of Candace)
Candace," No, Stacy, stop!"
Phone, Pictures sent.
Candace, I'm ruined.
Stacy," Well, he's at work, so maybe he hasn't looked yet."
Candace," We've got to get to Jeremy's phone, come on, we're going to Slushy Dog."
Phineas," (while Ferb is showing blueprints to him) Peanut butter and jelly robot races, masking tape mummy gymnastics, a jelly bean monetary system for emergenations...I don't know. I'm not feeling any of them."
Candace," Phineas and Ferb are up to something, I'd better tell Mom."
Stacy," Candace, the photos. (She pushes her away.) Eyes on the prize."
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you on Canada Day, but the world's top evil scientists have been photographed leaving Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. Something big is going on, real big. I need you to infiltrate his headquarters."
Carl, (off-screen) Ahem?
Major Monogram," Sorry. We need you to infiltrate his headquarters. Carl thinks I need to be more ""inclusive"". Find out what he's up to!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus. Have you come to sign my cast? (over a close-up of said cast, with multiple signatures on it) Look, I even saved a spot for you. It says, ""Save for Perry."" Well, it was a bigger spot before I wrote, ""Save for Perry,"" but there's some room in there. Grab that pen over there."
Doofenshmirtz," Ha! You ever hear of the Internet? Well, uh... this is just a net. But you're caught. (gets up and uses crutches to support him while he walks along) In exactly thirty minutes, the Tutti McFrutti ice cream man will park his truck in front of my building. I know, because I was standing there yesterday when HE RAN OVER MY FOOT! Now, using my Re-tire-Inator, I will throw a tire at him and seek my revenge. Get it? He ran over my foot with his tire, and I'm going to hit him with a giant, speeding tire. Re-tire. It's not retire, like stop working. That Retire-Inator is actually over there."
Doofenshmirtz," I've got it all set up with crossword puzzles, and a big, fat, lazy house cat that will sit on my lap and warm me into my...senior years. Now, where was I? Ah, yes. My evil laugh. (laughs manically)"
Buford," Little Master, I've washed all your dust jackets and dusted all your cold knick-knacks."
Baljeet," (over a shot of various foods placed on a bookshelf) Those are not knick-knacks! They are food, and they should be in the refrigerator!"
Buford," Ohh, I have failed you, Little Master. I will strive to do better."
Baljeet," Do not strive for anything, and I am not your little master."
Buford," Fine, then I'll just fluff up your pillow! (Baljeet runs away) Little Master? Little Master?"
Baljeet, Stay away from me!
Baljeet," (runs up) Phineas, Ferb I saved Buford's life, and now because of the Bully Code, he is my personal servant! It is driving me crazy! You have got to help me!"
Phineas," Okay, okay. We've just got to get Buford to save your life, and then you'll be even."
Baljeet, But how?
Phineas," Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Candace," Stacy, I see Jeremy's phone."
Stacy, Where?
Candace, There! His message light is still blinking. That means he hasn't retrieved his pictures yet!
Candace," Okay, let's just..."
Jeremy," What are you two doing here? I mean, not that I don't like surprise visits from you, but this room is for Slushy Dawg employees only."
Candace, We're Slushy Dawg employees.
Stacy, We are?
Candace, Yeah. We did our training at the downtown branch to surprise you. (beat) Surprise.
Jeremy," Hey, that's rad!"
Stacy," Candace, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. What are all these buttons for?"
Candace," It's hot dogs. How hard can it be? (gives Stacy some fries) Here, fry something. I'm gonna go etgay the onephay. (runs off)"
Stacy," Ugh, you know I don't speak Spanish!"
Candace, (gasps)
Jeremy," Oh, hey, Candace, I see you've sent me some pictures. I can't wait to check 'em out later when I take my break."
Candace, (fake smiling) Yeah! (frowning) No!
Stacy, I found out what all the buttons are for.
Baljeet," Oh, yes. This thing is definitely the thing! What is this thing?"
Phineas," This contraption, my friend, is completely foolproof."
Phineas," Let me explain. You'll ""accidentally"" step on to that platform, which will launch you up and over that flight of stairs, where you'll be kicked and rocketed through a piece of sheet-rock onto a trampoline. Then conveyer belted up to a rotating system that will drop you onto a spring, bouncing you all the way to that red X, where Buford will be standing, waiting to catch you, saving your life."
Baljeet," Ooh, I am thoroughly terrified, yet tingling with excitement!"
Jeremy," (offscreen) Candace? (walks up to her with headphones) While I check the stockroom, can you take the drive-thru orders?"
Candace," Ooh, my favorite!"
Candace," (on speakerbox) Uh, welcome to Slushy Dawg, can I take your order?"
Linda, Candace? You work here?
Candace, Mom?! You eat here?!
Linda," Honey, where are you? (waves) Can you see me? Candace?"
Candace, Uh— (walks over to Stacy) This is weird. My mom's here.
Stacy," I think your brothers are, too. Across the street."
Candace, What are they up to?
Linda, (on headphones) Candace?
Candace, Mom? Mom! Drive up to the window! You gotta see what the boys are doing!
Linda," The boys are here, too? Hon, I'm boxed in. I've got a heckuva line in front of me."
Candace," Fill orders, fill orders. (takes and gives a bag) Hi, enjoy your meal. (to the next car) Come again. Enjoy your meal. Bon appétit."
Phineas," Okay, Baljeet. You just stand on that platform and when Buford comes along, we'll guide him to the right spot. Although, it has occurred to us that you're giving up something really cool here."
Baljeet, What?
Phineas," You're spending all this energy trying to stop Buford from being your faithful servant, when the reality is having the biggest, toughest kid in town (Ferb nods) as your personal bodyguard is a sign of supreme coolness."
Baljeet, Really?
Phineas," Yeah, think about it."
Baljeet," Hmm, maybe you are right."
Doofenshmirtz," (offscreen) Ooh, hear that, Perry the Platypus?"
Doofenshmirtz," Tootie McFrutti has arrived on time! In a few seconds, he'll be flattened by a speeding tire."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh no! Oh no no no! (The inator hits Doof's good foot.) OW!!! NO!!! Oh, my good foot! My good foot! OW! Ow ow! My bad foot! Oh, my good foot again! Oh, no, my bad foot—Oh, this is really a viscous cycle!"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace, I'm takin' my break now."
Candace, Uh-huh. (laughs nervously)
Candace," Stacy, we gotta get Mom up here so she can see what the boys are doing. Keep throwing food out the window! (she leaves)"
Stacy, Okay.
Candace," Hey, Jeremy, can I borrow your phone? Thanks. Erase photos bust boys erase photos bust boys!"
Buford," Little Master, Little Master, I finished color-coding all of your overalls. Whadaya want me to do next?"
Baljeet," Well, first, I would like you to iron all of my books, then perhaps polish my retainer, then you can start my college applications. Massage my toosties. Sew my name onto my underwear, organize my book reports by subject. Ooh, build me—"
Buford," Weenie! (Buford pushes Baljeet out of the way.) Alright, we're even."
Baljeet," What? Aw, man."
Candace," Ha! All photos erased! Now, onto the boys! (runs up to the gang) Hey, just so you know, Mom's on her waaaaaaaay— (Candace steps on the platform and the contraption activates.)"
Phineas, Oops.
Linda," Stacy, you're here, too?"
Stacy, Yeah. Candace wants you to go out front to see what the boys are doing.
Linda," Well, just give me a chili dog and I'll be on my way."
Phineas, Sheetrock. (Crash!) Trampoline.
Candace, No! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Buford, I saved your life. Now you're my servant.
Candcae," Ugh, all right, ew! (gets up)"
Buford, But the code! You've got no honor!
Jeremy," Candace, wow! You okay?"
Candace," Um, yeah. Here's your phone."
Jeremy, (flips it open) There's a picture on it.
Candace, No no!
Jeremy," Hey, that's a great photo of you!"
Candace, Huh? Phew!
Jeremy, Now about your job...
Candace, No worries. I quit.
Buford," Hey, you guys wanna hit Slushy Dawg before we go home?"
Baljeet, Ew!
Phineas, Nah.
Ferb," Oh, heavens, no. Slushy Dawgs never get any better."
Linda, Candace? Boys? (looks at the contraption) Hmm. (beat) I'll never understand public art.
