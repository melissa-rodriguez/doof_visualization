Candace," I don't know, Stacy, between busting my brothers and trying to make Jeremy my boyfriend in time for school, I just can't seem get anything this summer. Like my ""Jeremy and Me"" scrapbook. I mean, I have cute pictures of Jeremy and cute pictures of me, but no cute pictures of both of us being cute together! It's a real problem. But time to check on Phineas and Ferb!"
Candace," Standing around, dorking it up, boring. There's just too much for one person to do. If only there were two of me, one to bust my brothers and one to be with Jeremy."
Buford, Look what Baljeet did to my candy bar. He got peanut butter on my chocolate. Look at this mess! Look at it! (shoves the candy bar in Phineas's face)
Phineas," Buford, peanut butter and chocolate are really good together."
Buford, I don't wanna taste two things at one time! It's unnatural.
Phineas," Well, you're in luck. We just finished our Molecular Separator. It's our cool new machine that breaks things down into their components parts. We used it to separate a mule into a horse and a donkey. And to separate shampoo plus conditioner into shampoo and conditioner. Ferb?"
Buford, Witchcraft!
Phineas, Try it.
Phineas, Well?
Buford, Singular goodness. (To Baljeet) Why don't you grab your peanut butter and your swimsuit and meet me at the flagpole. (He and Baljeet walk away.)
Phineas," Come on, let's see what else we can separate."
Monogram," Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been seen at the Danville public pool, installing some kind of new device. We need you to get there immediately. Good luck, Agent P."
Candace," Those kids are so busted! All I have to do is bring this to Mom. (tries to lift it) Wow, it's heavier than I thought."
Busting Candace, MUST...BUST...PHINEAS AND FERB.
Romantic Candace," Ah, Jeremy."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, I'm glad you're here. I'm just in line for the high dive. You see, it reminds me of the high dive I knew as a kid at the Gimmelshtump Public Wetness Maker."
Doofenshmirtz," (Narrating) It wasn't so much of a pool, as it was just a...we'll just say that it only had water in it on alternating Thursdays, and leave it at that."
Doofenshmirtz,"Anyhoo, in Gimmelshtump, the high dive was an important rite of passage."
Heinz's Father, Are you a man or a schnitzel?
Young Heinz," I'm a man, I'm a man."
Queuing man, Das kind ist ein schnitzel. (That kid is a schnitzel!)
Doofenshmirtz," (Narrating) With all those people looking and laughing at me, I-I just couldn't do it."
Heinz's Father, Ich habe keinen sohn. (I have no son.)
Doofenshmirtz," (Narrating) After that, my father and I became increasingly distant."
Heinz's Father, Zu nah! (Too close!)
Doofenshmirtz," Now, I will conquer my fear and jump from the high dive. But you know, I still don't want any of these people to look at me and make fun of me. So I invented the Look-Away-inator! You'd think it would attract a lot of attention at a public pool, but so far no one's noticed it. It must be leaking or something."
Doofenshmirtz," Anyway, when I do my man making dive, you can bet that no one in the Tri-State Area will be looking. Sure, it may be tough for people who happen to be driving, plus, brain surgeons might have a problem too. But it's really a small price to pay for me becoming a man, right?"
Doofenshmirtz, You're right. I gotta trap you.
Romantic Candace, Romance! lalalalala! It's a Jeremy bedroom.
Busting Candace, O. M. G.
Busting Candace," Mom, Phineas and Ferb made me!"
Linda," Um, I've got some stretch marks that would say otherwise."
Busting Candace," No, I mean, they split me in half. Well, not like I'm cut in half, but they've made another me. Hear for yourself."
Busting Candace, It's for you.
Romantic Candace, Hi Jeremy!
Busting Candace," Not Jeremy, it's Mom."
Romantic Candace," Oh, hi Mom. Here's Candace."
Busting Candace, See?
Linda," (from the phone) That was a very nice imitation of yourself, Candace. Love ya, bye."
Busting Candace," No, wait! Hello? Grrrrrr."
Phineas," Hi Candace, and hello to you, Candace."
Phineas," Uh-oh. Okay Ferb, change of plans."
Busting Candace," You need to focus on what's important, you touchy-feely ninny!"
Phineas," Hey, guys, so it appears there's been a little mishap. Let's say we fire up the ol' Molecular Splitter in reverse and..."
Busting Candace," Forget it! I've only got one thing on my mind, and that's busting you! I'm going to the mall to get Mom."
Romantic Candace, Wait for me!
Phineas," Well, I guess I know what we're gonna do today."
Busting Candace, Gotta find Mom.
Romantic Candace, Gotta find Jeremy.

Romantic Candace," Hi, Mom. Have you seen Jeremy?"
Linda, Doesn't he work over at that hot dog stand?
Romantic Candace," (dreamily) Oh, yeah."
Busting Candace," Mom, Mom! Have you seen me?"
Linda," Well, I see you right now. Weren't you looking for Jeremy?"
Busting Candace, No.
Glasses Seller," Wow, twins. That's a handful."
Linda, What?
Doofenshmirtz, You can go ahead if you want. I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Man, (knowingly) Uh-huh.
Doofenshmirtz, Have fun up there. (chuckles nervously; looks to the kid next in line) So...
Kid," Don’t talk to me, Mister."
Jeremy," There you go, little guy."
Jeremy," Hey, Candace."
Busting Candace, Have you seen Candace?
Jeremy," Well, I can see you right now."
Busting Candace," No, no, no, no. Not ""me"" me. The ""me"" that isn't me."
Jeremy, (Confused) Uh...
Busting Candace," You know, ""blah-blah-blah. Jeremy is so amazing. Hearts, rainbows, and unicorns, blah!"" That me."
Jeremy," (Confused) Well, gosh. I guess I could say, yes, I have."
Busting Candace, Where?
Jeremy," (Scared) Nowhere. I mean, not today."
Busting Candace," Ugh! Well, if I come back and I have a flower in my hair, you tell me. Find Candace, find Mom. Bust, bust, bust."
Romantic Candace," Hi, Jeremy."
Jeremy," Uh, hey, Candace. You have a flower in your hair."
Romantic Candace, (chuckles) I know.
Jeremy," Okay, you're kinda scaring me."
Romantic Candace, (sighs contentedly) I could just stare at you all day long.
Jeremy," Listen, I gotta get back to work, but if you like, I can swing by your house after I'm done."
Romantic Candace, Really? I would love that!
Jeremy," Okay then, I'll see you after work."
Romantic Candace," Something to remember me by? (points to her cheek, smiling)"
Jeremy, Okay.
Jeremy," Okay, maybe later."
Phineas," Hey, Jeremy."
Jeremy," Hey, guys."
Phineas, Have you seen Candace?
Jeremy," Yeah, she was just here."
Phineas, Was she talking about busting or was she oogling over you?
Jeremy," Uh...both. She said something about going to find the ""other Candace"" and-and Mom and then she went all wild when I mentioned stopping by tonight."
Phineas," Great! So if we just find Mom, we'll find both Candaces."
Jeremy," (Confused) Uh, tell them I say hi."
Kid," Mister, come on. It's your turn. Are you some kind of a schnitzel?"
Doofenshmirtz," I am a man! Not a schnitzel. (Climbing up the high dive) I will prove it right now! (scoffs) Nobody calls me schnitzel anymore! I bet he doesn't even know what it means the little... (He reaches the top) Hey, hey, wait a minute. This isn't as bad as I remember...it's so much worse! (Clings onto the diving board)"
Kid, (Flatly sighs) Schnitzel.
Busting Candace," Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! She's here! I have Candace here with me! Come out and look for yourself!"
Busting Candace, See? (Gestures next to her with eyes closed) Two of us!
Linda," Well, actually, right now I can see four of you."
Busting Candace, That slippery vixen! Don't move. I'll be right back. (runs off)
Linda," (sighs tiredly) Yes, yes, you will."
Busting Candace," Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust."
Romantic Candace, My Jeremy is going to love this!
Phineas, There she is.
Linda," Well, I'm heading out. You want a ride?"
Romantic Candace, But my sugar-boo is still...
Phineas," Candace, isn't Jeremy coming over? You should be home getting ready."
Romantic Candace," Oh, they're right! Mom, let's go!"
Linda, How about you kids?
Phineas, Don't worry. We'll be home soon.
Phineas," One Candace down, one to go."
Phineas,"Busting Candace Phineas, Ferb! Have you seen the other Candace?"
Phineas, We just saw her. She's driving away with Mom.
Phineas," If the Molecular Splitter doesn't just disappear when this is over, we should really consider destroying it."
Ferb, Agreed.
Romantic Candace," My Jeremy, my Jeremy, and I will be forever. My Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy will leave me never. Ooh, Jeremy. Yay, Jeremy!"
Linda, What was that noise?
Romantic Candace, Jeremy's coming! Gotta get ready for Jeremy!
Busting Candace, Where is she?
Linda, Where is who?
Busting Candace," Candace, she was with you in the car!"
Linda," Yes, ""she"" was."
Busting Candace, And?
Man," Come on buddy, let's go!"
Kid," (has climbed up the diving board) Watch out, schnitzel! (skillfully dives into the pool)"
Man, Yeah!
Kid, Boo-yah!
Woman, Now that's a man!
Phineas," Hey, Candace, look who's here early."
Romantic Candace, Ooh! My Jeremy is here! I'll be right with you my love! (disappears from the window to rush to downstairs)
Phineas," Wow, she bought it. (Turns around giving a thumbs up to Ferb, who is dressed up like Jeremy) I guess love is blind."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, okay, I'll show you. My Turn-Away-inator and I are ready to go! (presses the button and everyone at the pool looks to the side, away from Doofenshmirtz) That's right, look away."
Sculptor, (Sarcastically) Fantastic.
Brain Surgeon," Uh, has everyone paid up on their insurance bill?"
Woman, I taste lilacs.
Romantic Candace, My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here!
Busting Candace," Busted, busted, busted, mom!"
Phineas," Ferb, now."
Phineas, Yikes.
Linda," All right Candace, I'm here."
Doofenshmirtz," Now I'm ready. (His head suddenly turns to the side) Oh, I didn't realize it would affect me, too! Not ready!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Flailing in the water) Ah, I can't swim! I am a schnitzel! I am a schnitzel!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Stops shouting and flailing) Curse you and thank you, Perry the Platypus."
Phineas, What are we looking at?
Ferb, I have no idea.
Linda," I could've sworn there were more people here. What did you want, Candace?"
Candace, (Sighs) Nothing.
Linda, Suit yourself. (Leaves)
Singing Monogram, ♪ I wanna sing! ♪ (Laughs)
Major Monogram, I try so hard to keep you under wraps.
Candace," (At herself) I can't do anything right, even with two of me! I can't bust my brothers. I can't even..."
Jeremy," There you are, Candace."
Candace, Jeremy?
Jeremy, (Holding the frame Romantic Candace had bought) Your mom said you got this for me at the mall today.
Candace," Uh, no, I mean, that wasn't really me. I mean...not all of me. I mean...oh, this isn't coming out right."
Jeremy," Well, I think it's pretty cool."
Candace, You do?
Jeremy, The only thing is it needs a picture. Anybody got a camera?
Phineas, We're on it.
Ferb, (Holds up a camera) Say fromage.
Candace/Jeremy, Fromage!
