Isabella," There you are, Isabella! (Laughs) I made a funny. It's always humorous when one refers to oneself in the third-person. You try it, Pinky."
Isabella," Yeah, not a hard and fast rule, I guess. What's that? I hear a sash calling me to earn it some more new patches. Come on, Pinky."
Gretchen, Sesquipedalian.
Milly," Here's your ""Saying a Word No One Else in the Room Knows"" patch! Does anyone else want to try?"
Gretchen, Shh! Someone's coming! Defense positions.
Gretchen," Look alive, people! It's our fearless leader."
Isabella," Hey, guys, what'cha doin'?"
Holly, Earning patches!
Isabella," So, did you guys decide what patch to get today? 'Cause I have a suggestion!"
Adyson," Let me guess. The ""Let's Help Phineas and Ferb"" patch?"
Isabella," It's called the ""Help Thy Neighbor"" patch, Adyson. Don't make up patch names."
Ginger, I already have 52 of those.
Milly," I have 53. Remember, I went back one afternoon after everyone else went home."
Isabella, I know. Don't remind me.
Gretchen, You just want an excuse to see Phineas.
Isabella, The very thing I live for.
Adyson," All right, then! Let's go see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!"
Ginger, Why don't we ever go see what Baljeet is doing?
Milly, Because we've done that before.
Holly," Yeah, and that patch wasn't worth it."
Isabella," Hey, where's Pinky?"
Wanda Acronym," Hello, Agent Pinky. Professor Poofenplotz has been making a barrage of inquiries about hairspray, of all things. It's all very suspicious. Suss it out and put the kibosh on it."
Isabella," Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?"
Phineas," Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I've been doing. Always getting so wrapped up in these silly projects that I don't care about. It's you I care about, Isabella! (changes into a centaur and Isabella rides off on him) Can we be together forever and ever?"
Isabella, Yeah! We can definitely do that.
Phineas," Excellent. (Record scratches and Isabella's fantasy fades away) While they're getting that, we can finish our designs on the transponder. See you girls back at the field."
Isabella," Okay, Phineas! Oh, my gosh. What did he say? What does he need? (Sighs) I was in Phineasland again."
Gretchen," We'll explain on the way, Chief. Right now, we have to find the rare maracanut tree, and earn our ""Sap Collecting"" patch."
Milly, What's that patch for?
Ginger," It's the ""I Just Saw a Cute Boy"" patch."
Milly, Where?
Ginger, Duh! (points to Baljeet) That one over there with the color-coded schedule.
Poofenplotz, ♪ It's important to look your very best when you're doing your very worst. ♪
Worker," Can I help you with something, ma'am?"
Poofenplotz, Yes. Can you tell me where you've moved your Stiff Beauty hair spray?
Worker," Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am. That product has been discontinued. As it turns out, only amusement park clowns used it. And ever since the old amusement park shut down, Stiff Beauty hasn't been selling."
Poofenplotz, Discontinued?
Worker, Discontinued.
Poofenplotz, So what you're saying is Stiff Beauty's no longer going to be sold.
Worker," Right. That's what ""discontinued"" means."
Poofenplotz, (after a pause) How about I discontinue YOU from this dimension!
Worker, This so isn't worth minimum wage.
Poofenplotz, The only supply of Stiff Beauty left in the world is at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park. And I intend to use my Me-Mobile to get me there!
Gretchen," According to this Fireside Girls book on dendrology, the maracanut tree is indigenous to mountain valley micro-climates. So it looks like we're heading in the right direction."
Isabella," Hi. Excuse me. Um, hello. Earth to hippie. (Imitates Didgeridoo reverb) Excu-u-u-u-u-u-use Me-e-e-e-e-e-e."
The Guru, Whoa! You just harmonized with me.
Fireside Girls, Oooh!
Isabella, Would you possibly know where the maracanut trees might be located?
The Guru," Indeed I do, my formidable little flower. Behold. (Shows tree stumps)"
Isabella," Oh, no! What happened? Where did they all go?"
The Guru, They were all chopped down so their sap could be used for... (Tears up) ...hair spray. Such a shame.
Isabella," So, there aren't any left?"
The Guru," Don't fret, my pet. There happens to be one sole maracanut tree left in existence. It's at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park over on the next hill."
Isabella," Did you just say ""the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park""?"
The Guru, Yes. The old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park.
Isabella," ""Old abandoned"" twice?"
The Guru, Yes.
Isabella, All right.
The Guru," Step up, little sister. Let me bestow upon you the Key of Wisdom. (Drops key) Bask in its glory!"
The Guru," Cool, huh?"
Isabella, Um...
Fireside Girls, He's gone!
Adyson, Wow.
Gretchen," No, he's not. He's right over there. (Points to The Guru, trying to make an escape quietly)"
The Guru," Oh, uh... Hey! hey, hi... Hey, little sisters. See you on the flip side!"
Candace," So, Mom, am I doing great or what?"
Linda," Well, ""Or what."" Candace. Trash cans!"
Isabella," Well, here we are, I guess. Oh, I get it! It was actually called ""The Old Abandoned Amusement Park""! And now it's old and abandoned. Hence, ""old abandoned"" twice. Girls, we're goin' in. We've got a tree to find! (The girls race to various attractions in the park) Fireside Girls, report!"
Katie," Nothing up here, Captain!"
Gretchen," Ditto, Chief!"
Holly, It just smells like feet in here.
Ginger, These clown lockers are just full of cheap hair spray!
Isabella," It has to be around here somewhere. Creepy roadside hippie gurus are generally reliable. Wait, I think I found it! (Points at a tall ride in the back of the park)"
Ginger, Yeah!
Milly," I think you're right, Chief."
Adyson, This should be it.
Gretchen," This must be it, Chief. I think you're right."
Isabella," (Reading a placard near the ride) ""Stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses, and of all the stickinesses, the sap of the maracanut tree is the sticky-messiest. This Temple of Sap attraction is a monument to the rare and beautiful maracanut tree, the world's greatest stickerizer."" Looks like we've tracked our quarry to its lair, girls! Although, if their biggest attraction was a sap-themed ride, I understand why this place closed down. Girls, get your gear. We're climbin' up."
Holly, Probably not a good idea. (Punches the wall of the ride) The whole thing's structurally unsound.
Adyson, Look out!
Adyson, The whole place will fall!
Gretchen, And there's no way to get that tree!
Isabella," Calm down, girls. Have you forgotten who we are? We're Fireside Girls Troop 46321, and we never give up!"
All," ♪ We're Fireside Girls, one and all ♪"
Isabella," So, let's procure the sap for Phineas!"
Fireside Girls," Yay, Phineas!"
Isabella," Oh, and Ferb too!"
Fireside Girls, And Ferb too!
Ginger, And Baljeet!
Isabella," Well, the old hippie didn't mention how to get to the top of that, all he gave us was this Key of Wisdom."
Adyson, Groovy!
Katie, Jinkies!
Milly, Far out!
Gretchen, Dy-no-mite!
Poofenplotz," Pinky the Chihuahua! Well, Momma knows haw to deal with bad little doggies!"
Poofenplotz, Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad do...
Isabella," Well, there's no engine, but it looks like gravity will do the trick."
Isabella," All right, girls. Are we ready to get that ""Reckless Disregard for Life and Limb"" patch?"
Fireside Girls," Aye-aye, Captain!"
Isabella," All right, ladies! Lean!"
Fireside Girls, Lean!
Gretchen," So, how exactly is this gonna work?"
Isabella," Girls, sashes! Now!"
Isabella," Gretchen, you have the controls."
Gretchen, What good will that do?!
Isabella, Just trust me!
Isabella," Oh, my goodness, what a cute little tree!"
Milly and Katie, Aww.
Gretchen, Isabella? What now? We're gonna CRAAAASH!!!
Isabella," Oh, no, we're not. Everybody... lean! (They all lean on the port side of the van, causing it to spiral down to the ground. As it lowers, it snaps the wire on Pinky's grappling hook. The van lands successfully on the ground. The Fireside Girls cheer.)"
Isabella," Okay, girls. It's time to tap that sap!"
Katie, I'm on it!
Holly," Hold it still, Katie. (She captures the sap in a test tube) We got it, Isabella!"
Isabella," Hey, Phineas. We got that sap you guys needed."
Phineas," Excellent, Isabella! That's the last ingredient we need. (Isabella looks delighted) Now all we have to do is... (changes into a centaur) run away together."
Gretchen," Isabella? (Record scratch) Isabell-a? Phineas said, ""Thanks."""
Isabella," ""Thanks."" He really does appreciate me."
Gretchen," (Pushing the infatuated Isabella off-screen) Yes. Yes, he does."
Poofenplotz," Yes! At last, my own lifetime supply of Stiff BEAUTY!!!!!"
Poofenplotz," (through gritted teeth) I may be stiff, but at least I'm beautiful."
Poofenplotz," Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua...!"
