,Scene opens up showing Phineas and Ferb under a tree.
Phineas," And the candidates for what awesome thing we will do today are: Our blueprint for completely food-based water park, your schematic for the tunnel to the center of the Earth, this model for the chamber of invisibility, your other schematic for a microscopic zoo that rests on the head of a pin. Gee. We sure have lots of blueprints, models, and schematics."
Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. Summer doesn't last forever, and we've got too many plans for just the two of us. We either need more days of summer, or more of us. What's this? The blueprint for that robot we invented? Ferb, you're a genius! We can make android versions of ourselves! We can make Phinedroids and Ferbots! Hey, where's Perry?"
Santa Claus, Ho-ho-hold that elevator!
Major Monogram," Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made 57 phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom, or why."
Major Monogram,"No, not to Santa. Agent P, your mission is to find out what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to and stop him. See, Carl, that's why I don't like using the chimney vator. Besides, that guy totally owes me a pony from when I was five."
Phineas," Okay, Ferb. The robot building device is almost ready to be activated. Just a couple more commands. (Computer beeping) Okay, pictures please."
Computer, Phineas. Ferb. Phineas and Ferb.
Phineas, Here we go.
Computer, Robot building sequence activated.
Phineas," Wow, it worked! I'm so glad we tried our new android building device instead of using that old dinosaur. (Beep)"
Phinedroids/Ferbots, ♪ We're Phinedroids and Ferbots and we're stomping our feet ♪
Doofenshmirtz," Pick up the phone! Pick up, pick up! Pick up, pick up! Oh, why won't you pick up? (At Perry) Oh, hi, Perry the Platypus. Thank you for using the key I gave you. It's much more civilized than crashing through my ceiling, don't you think? Yes, eh. Anyway, I-I don't know why you're here, but you can tell Monogram that I'm not, eh, you know, ""up to anything."" Anyways, all I've been doing is calling my new girlfriend. (Laughs) We're having, what I call, a relationship bump. And now, she won't pick up the phone, and I'm tired of leaving messages. I'm tired! I've—I left, like, 57 messages and, I won't leave anymore. It starts to look a little desperate."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm? Oh, no, that's not an evil scheme. That's just a giant magnet. I'm going to wave it over my girlfriend's house and erase all the messages I left. (Laughs) Because, some of them are long and rambly. I know, there's an ordinance against it, but... What? Oh, come on, Perry the Platypus! (Growls) Oh well, too bad for you! Too bad you don't believe in love! (Door slams, Truck engine revving) Too bad!"
Candace," I'd love to come over and watch you get your ears pierced, Stacy, but my Mom went to Zippy Pics and left me in charge of my brothers. (Sees a Phinedroids out the door) Oh, here they come now, (smirks, another Phinedroid walks by) Phineas and Ferrrruh, Phineas? (Gasps) I'll have to call you back!"
Candace,"Oh, wait till Mom finds out about Phineas and Ferb, and...Phineas and Ferb and Phineas? Ferb? Phineas and Ferb? Phineas and Ferb? Ferbias, Phiniferb? (Gasps) They're my brothers and they're robots! THEY'RE BRO-BOTS!"
Linda," What is it, Candace?"
Candace," Mom, I'm in the panic room...Phineas and Ferb...and—And then Phineas and Ferb...and—And robots! (voice becomes squeaky) Invisibility chamber! Elephants!"
Linda," That's nice, honey. Well, the pictures should be ready soon, and then I'll see the robots when I get home. Bye. (Phone beeps)"
Candace," Everything will be gone once Mom gets home. Isn't that right, Mr. Miggins? Unless..."
Candace,"Aha! (Phone beeping) Stacy? Oh my gosh! Guess what? Ugh, Stacy, I can't understand you. Why are you crying? Yeah. Crying, crying, it hurts, right. Got that. Uh-huh, Oh, hi, Mrs. Hirano! What? Stacy got her ears pierced? And it hurts badly, so you have to help her get them un-pierced? Gee, what a terrible thing that I had completely no idea about! Anyway, gotta run, Mrs. Hirano. Give Stacy my best! (Kicks bag) Poor, mixed-up Stacy. (Throughout this, a garbage truck arrives. A man takes the bag with the Ferbots in it and tosses it into the dump area. It drives away, and a Fred's Fertilizer truck pulls up. A man drops off a bag of fertilizer and the truck drives off. Candace barely notices)"
Phineas," Hey, bros. How's the old Chamber of Invisibility coming along?"
Phineas,"Wow, it works! Well done. (At Ferb) Hey, normally I'd be saying that to you, Ferb. Just kinda weird saying that to a Ferbot. Let's see how the Microscopic zoo is going. (At Robots) Hey, guys. Mind if we see how things are coming along? (At Ferb) Hold her steady, Ferb. Wow! That's amazing! And according to this microscopic newspaper machine, the zoo's really packing them in! Well, I guess we can categorize this project as a success. Hey, that's the best tunnel to the center of the Earth I've ever seen. Boy, I bet that was fun to build. You know, Ferb, even if these robots we're a complete success and completely on model, I kind of miss working on stuff. You know, just you and me. Hey, what's this? Thanks. Hovercraft lounge chair? We were gonna build that next week! Oh, no! The Phinedroids and Ferbots are running out of projects, so they're designing their own! Have we learned nothing from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Oh, look! They're starting their own overpriced coffee franchise! That's so '90s."
Phineas, This is terrible! We have an entirely new problem!
Phineas,The coffee's making them haywire! And that one's having trouble falling asleep.
Phineas,Poor little guy. (Robot whirring) That's it! You guys are drinking way too much coffee! I'm shutting her down!
Phineas,"Well, that's no good. Time to show these robots who's in charge. (Presses laptop button repeatedly) Uh, Ferb? I think they're in charge."
Doofenshmirtz," (Singing along) ♪ Bow, chicka bow-wow, that's what my baby says... ♪"
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, there it is. (Turns off radio) My new girlfriend's house. Now I can erase all those embarrassing messages. And then I can start leaving new ones. What? (stops car, sees Perry with a spy badge and gasps) Perry the Platypus! How did you escape my net? It was the mouse, wasn't it? Get out of the way, Perry the Platypus!! Don't make me drop this giant magnet on you! Well, then, as a lazy tailor would say, ""Suit yourself."" (Flips switch, Clang; Christmas music)"
Doofenshmirtz, But that doesn't make sense! It's the middle of July!
Santa Claus," Ho, ho, ho! I'm on a summer run! Farewell, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz," Bah, humbug."
Phineas," So this is how it ends, Ferb. Defeated by our own doppelgängers. If only we had some device that can stop them from..."
Phineas," (Laughs) I know, I'm just messing with ya."
Phinedroids and Ferbots, ♪ We're Phinedroids and Ferbots and we're here to stay ♪
Candace," (Scoffs) '80s music is so 2002. (Car door opens) Mom, mom, mom!"
Linda," Oh, hi, honey. I got some very nice shots here."
Candace," Yeah, that's great, Mom. Check this out! (opens fertilizer bag with eyes closed) Ta-da!"
Linda," That's a very nice bag of manure, Candace."
Candace," (opens her eyes, looks in bag) What? AAAAH!"
Linda, Candace! You made me drop my pictures!
Candace, Maybe it's not too late!
Candace," Mom, mom, mom! You've gotta see this!"
Candace," I know. I've done this nineteen other times. (closes eyes) But this time, I can say with the utmost confidence that there are Phineas and Ferb robots in the backyard!"
Linda," (referring to the real Phineas and Ferb) Yes, Candace. There are ""Phineas and Ferb robots"" in the backyard."
