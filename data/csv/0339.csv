Phineas, (from inside) It's coming!
Isabella, AAAAHHHHH!!! We're doomed!
Baljeet, The prophecy has come true!
Phineas, We are about to pay for our over-consumption!
Buford," You created me, Garbage-zilla! And now, puny humans, Prepare to be trashed! (trips and makes a loud noise) Whoa, whoa!"
Candace, Knock it off!
Linda," Candace, I don't know what you kids are doing, but I'm taking an online knitting test in a few minutes, and I need it to be quiet around here. (sarcastic tone) You might not remember quiet. I'm not sure you two ever met. Anyway I'm putting you on noise patrol. You're in charge."
Candace, I'm in charge? Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Linda, Use a muffler. (leaves)
Candace," (She grabs and puts a cushion over her face.) Oh, yeah. Woo-ho!"
Buford," This time I want an air siren, and tap shoes."
Candace," Phineas, Ferb, Mom put me on noise patrol while she's taking an online test. She needs it to be... (loudly) ABSOLUTELY QUIET!"
Linda," (from upstairs) Candace, I'm trying to concentrate! (going back to her computer) Now let's see: ""What's the first ingredient in knitting a garment?"" Oh, I know that, it's love. (types it down, only to get the wrong answer) What do you mean, ""wool""?"
Candace," You heard her, right? No noise. I want you silent, and invisible. Got it? (leaves)"
Buford, Silent and invisible!? What am I? A ninja?
Phineas," That's it! Gang, I know what we're gonna do today! (pause) Speaking of silent and invisible, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Agent P, we have a crisis. The Agency was going through Dr. Doofenshmirtz's trash this week when we found this. (shows a magazine with doodled on cover) Defaced magazine cover. Shameful! There were hundreds of similar defaced photos of good looking men, (shows a magazine of him on the cover with a devil face drawn onto it) including this handsome devil gracing the cover of Covert Lifestyles. My interest in this incident is purely professional, but put a stop to it!"
Major Monogram, (sobbing) Wh-hy? WH-H-H-HY?
Doofenshmirtz," Hold on, Perry the Platypus, I'm just getting the mail. Oh, goody! It's my order from the Power Tool and Skeleton Key Warehouse. I was wondering when this was gonna -- OH! Look! At! This! Every week, the mailman makes the same mistake and I end up getting my neighbor's HS Weekly. Here, hold this, Perry the Platypus, I need to rant. (puts mail in front of Perry) I hate all these good-looking models on the cover of Handsome and Symmetrical Magazine, mocking me with their manly perfection. Their perfect hair, their perfect skin, I hate it! And this, is why I created...the De-Handsome-inator! Soon, all these good looking faces will be hideous! (Perry, free, punches him) Ow! Wait, did you use the skeleton key or was it the power tools?"
Doofenshmirtz," Just for that, I'm not gonna tell you why the apple --"
Doofenshmirtz," Ugh, you know, I don't have the energy for this. It's still early, do you wanna go grab some lunch? Come on. I skipped breakfast this morning. (he and Perry walk out) You like eggs?"
Phineas," Okay, gang, Ferb and I made these ninja outfits using smart garment technology. Once they're switched on, the outfits are designed to hide the wearer from anyone who's not wearing the suit."
Candace," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I smell noise! Is that what the black pajamas are for? You gonna have a noise party?"
Phineas," Actually, it's the opposite. We're ninjas. Ninjas are renowned for their quiet and concealment. We made an outfit for you, too. (points to a ninja outfit for Candace)"
Buford, You should put it on. Take it from me. Black is slimming.
Candace," No, thanks."
Phineas," That's okay. We'll leave it here for you in case you change your mind. (at his friends) All right, ninjas! Let's turn on our outfits!"
Candace," Hey! Where'd everyone go? (She turns around several times, but the kids keep sneaking automatically out of her sight.) That's so weird. Huh. Oh, I'll find them. (goes inside)"
Buford," That was cool! I didn't have to do anything! The outfit did all the work! Whoa Phineas, which way are you facing?"
Phineas, Good question.
Phineas, Left.
Candace," Stupid, stealthy ninjas! (slams door)"
Linda," Candace, keep it down! (at herself) ""What do you call a clever knitter?"" (pause) I know! A knit wit! Heh! Is there anything better than knitting humor?"
Doofenshmirtz," I need to stop at the bank, I-I don't have any cash."
Woman 1, Ah... (faints)
Man 1," (opens bank door for Doofenshmirtz) It's an honor, sir! A real honor! I can't wait to tell my wife!"
Woman 2," Ooh, are you famous? You look like a model, are you an actor? You go first, I can wait!"
Man 2," Please, I'm just getting some cash to pay medicine for my kids."
Doofenshmirtz," (at the bank teller) Yes, uh, hello. I just need to make a withdrawal from my account, please."
Bank teller," (gives him money bags) Here, take this. It's on us."
Doofenshmirtz," No, no. J-just enough for lunch."
Waitress, Sparkling sider?
Water, Scrambled eggs? That's real lobster in there.
Photographer, Preserve the moment! (takes his picture)
Doofenshmirtz," Can you believe the service in this place, Perry the Platypus?"
Photographer, Here you go! All framed. (gives him the picture takes
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, ah, thank you! Eh -- (sees his picture) Heh heh, see, this isn't me. This is just the superhumanly attractive male model that came with the frame. I mean, look at this guy, right? That's funny, he's wearing a lab coat just like me -- (Perry holds up a mirror) Uhhhh?! Oh, this is horrible! I can't be handsome! It's -- it's everything I despise! Don't you understand? Beautiful people, they -- they just get everything they want in the world. I mean, watch this. Hey, lady, nice baby."
Woman 3, You want him? He likes you better.
Doofenshmirtz," No, I don't want your baby. (at Perry) You see, Perry the Platypus, the unfair advantage good-looking people have? (becomes conceited) Heeeey?! (at a man) If I ran for Mayor, would you vote for me?"
Man 3, Over and over again.
Man 4," No, elections are for ugly people. I'm sure they'd just give him the mayorship."
Doofenshmirtz, Ya think?
Policeman," Sure, you've already got a sizeable mob, and I bet we could pick up a couple thousand more on the way."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, okay, then! On to City Hall!"
Candace, My busting sense is tingling...
Candace, There's something Phineas and Ferb going on here...
Candace, Phineas?
Candace, Ferb? (opens the door to Phineas and Ferb's room) You in here? (closes door)
Candace, Phineas? Ferb! (opens another door)
Candace, Phineas! Phineas!
Candace, I know you're here!
Linda," (opens the door to her room) And the whole Tri-State Area knows you're here, Candace! Again, could you please keep it down?! (closes door)"
Phineas," (quietly, behind Candace) I tried to tell you before."
Candace," (turns around) Aha! (sees no one, constantly turns around) Uh...uh..."
Phineas," You'll never be able to see us, unless you wear a ninja outfit yourself."
Candace," Oh, I'll wear a ninja outfit, all right! Then, I'll bust the whole lot of you. (walks off, Phineas is on her back)"
Doofenshmirtz, ♪ My jaw is rugged ♪
Man 5, My company wants to give you a life time supply of our distinctive hand mirrors.
Doofenshmirtz, Send them over. (he's handsome)
Woman 4, I'm gonna name all my children after you even though they're already in college.
Doofenshmirtz, Nice! (he's handsome)
Doofenshmirtz,Get in line ladies! (he's handsome)
Doofenshmirtz,"I'm a total catch, really (he's handsome)"
Doofenshmirtz,I'm quite fetching (fetching/handsome)
Doofenshmirtz,"It's a word, it is! (he's handsome)"
Roger," Well, well, well Heinz. At the age of 47, you've finally grown into your looks!"
Doofenshmirtz," Yes. Yes, I have."
Roger," In fact, it would be our pleasure to suspend democracy and make you our Supreme Leader."
Roger," Do you have any questions, yo-o-o-ou handsome devil?"
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm, how is my hair?"
Woman 5, He's handsome and funny!
Woman 6, This'll be the perfect place to watch the coronation!
Man 6, I can't believe how fast they mass-produced these commemorative hot air balloons.
Delivery man, Hand mirror delivery!
Candace," (singsong) Phineas? Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Candace," Okay, you guys are so busted, and I have the evidence right here on my body. (runs off) Woo hoo! Mom! Mom!"
Buford, I knew she'd come back for the slimming.
Candace," Okay, I know you're super busy and all, but you have just got to see what Phineas and Ferb made. I'm wearing it."
Linda," Candace, this test is time sensitive!"
Candace, Just one second!
Linda," Oh, all right. (turns around, Candace is gone) What? Where'd you go?"
Candace," I'm right here, on the ceiling."
Linda," (looks up, Candace disappears) What?"
Candace," I'm right here, under the rug!"
Linda," (looks down, Candace disappears again) Young lady..."
Candace," Heh, now, I'm on the shelf."
Linda," I don't know how you're throwing your voice and I understand that you want attention, but I'm really, really busy."
Candace, It's the outfit! (takes mask off) It won't let you see me.
Linda," But, it apparently has no qualms about letting me hear you."
Candace," (takes entire suit off) Mom, here it is! Mom! (closes eyes)"
Linda," All right, Candace... (turns around, the suit bounces out of Candace's arms) What am I looking at?"
Candace, (gasps)
Buford, These outfits were fun!
Isabella, I've never moved so fast!
Baljeet, Oh! That was quite a workout.
Phineas, Hey! It's Candace's ninja outfit! It's hiding! She must've left it switched on. (turns off the suit)
Roger," And now, I finally pronounce you..."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here to see this."
Doofenshmirtz," What's that? My inator remote? You're wasting your time. There's no way you'll get a clear line of fire from my place to here, what with all hose commemorative hot air balloons in the way. How do they mass-produce those so fast? (Perry presses the remote, the De-Handsome-inator fires the hand mirror attached to the back of one of the balloons, another off a mailbox, a third off a building, off a pack of cars, off another mirror carried by a pigeon, and through the crowd until it finally hits Doofenshmirtz, reverting him to his old, ugly self)"
Roger, Ew.
Man 7, He suddenly looks so...unqualified.
Policeman," Please disperse, nothing handsome to see here."
Woman 7," Hey, let's go look at fashion magazines!"
Woman 8," Yeah, that sounds great."
Phineas, ...And they fold down to almost nothing.
Candace," (from her window) Phineas, do not go anywhere. (walks into Linda's room) The ninja outfits, they're still there! Hurry! Wait till you see this. (drags Linda on her chair with her outside)"
Phineas," ...By pressing the ""on ""button, the outfits put themselves away."
Candace, There! Bust them! (closes eyes)
Linda," Oh, hi kids. I wanna thank you for being so quiet all afternoon. (at Candace) Unlike...someone I know!"
Candace, But...but but...
Phineas," Hey Mom, how your test go?"
Linda," (flatly) Well, lucky for Candace, I just passed. (enthusiastic) Anyone for pie?"
All but Ferb, (jump for joy) Me!
Linda," (in a stern tone) Mush, Candace."
Roger, So sorry. It looks like your small window of fleeting beauty is now gone. (leaves)
Doofenshmirtz," I don't understand! How -- how is is possible? Uh -- you did this, Perry the Platypus!"
Phineas," Coming, bro?"
Ferb, D'you ever notice in a certain light Buford looks...handsome?
Buford," It's a blessing, and a curse."
