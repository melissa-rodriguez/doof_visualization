Phineas," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We thought it only fair that the show you're about to see may disturb you. It may shock you. It may even horrify you!"
Ferb, (Spew out a hairball)
Phineas, You've been warned.
Phineas," Looks like a real summer storm! (Thunder crashes) Well, our plan to stand alone in a field with a metal rod is out."
Grandpa Reg, (Reading a newspaper) This weather isn't fit for man nor platypus.
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," (Comes out of curtains) Good morning, Agent P. (Puts his arms behind him) The mission you're about to receive may shock you. It may even horrify you! But then again, probably not, I mean, heh. You have been doing this for awhile. Anyway, sorry about the tarp behind me. Storm caused some water damage, and-- (Looks at his watch) Ooh! Cheese and crackers! Late for my cousin's wedding. Gotta go. Doofenshmirtz is up to something, and you know what to do."
Phineas, Hmm. I wonder where Perry goes off to.
Grandpa Reg," Lost your platypus, eh? (Camera zooms out) That reminds me of a really great monkey story."
Phineas," Tell us, Grandpa!"
Grandpa Reg, It's about Ferb's ancestor. He was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great uncle.
Candace, Great.
Grandpa Reg," (Turns on a flashlight) It was a long time ago, back in the old country, on a cold moonlit night."
Grandpa Reg, Your great uncle Ferbgor was assisting the famous Dr. Phineastein (In the flashback a platypus walks up) in the macabre task of collecting spare parts from semi-aquatic mammals. (In the flashback the platypus gives Ferbgor a steering wheel and runs off)
Dr. Phineastein," Hey, Ferbgor, the Monkey's (Ferbgor walks up) Ball Best Monkey Contest. A big prize goes to the best monkey! Sweet. I know what we're gonna do today! (Cackles)"
Grandpa Reg," (Narrating) Back at Castle Phineastein, the boys began building a monkey."
Candace," (Jumps in) Can you at least tell a story in color, Grandpa? (The flashback changes into color. The castle's in different colors, the sky is pink with a rainbow behind the castle)"
Phineas," (Jumps in) Perhaps muted color would be better. (The flashback turns into a faded green and muted grey background, with the characters in the flashback now in color)"
Grandpa Reg, (Jumps in) Who's telling the story anyway? (Grandpa Reg goes off and Candace and Phineas run off-screen. The camera zooms into the castle) Did I mention that the boys had a conniving and disapproving governess named Constance?
Constance," (While using a quill) So, anyway, (Clattering) Jeremiah was, like, totally checking me out when-- Will you hold it down? I am trying to use the quill!"
Phineastein," Isn't it beautiful, Ferbgor? We're on the verge of bringing life to the (Walks to the counter) best monkey ever. Okay, let her rip!"
Dr. Phineastein, It's alive! ALIVE!!! (Laughs maniacally and the platypus monkey sits up) And it's really big.
Phineas," How big, Grandpa?"
Grandpa Reg, Bigger than a refrigerator but smaller than a really big refrigerator.
Doofenshmirtz," Don't close that door! (The door slams. The camera zooms out and he walks on-screen holding a candle) Oh, that's just great! The storms made my security system go all cuckoo, and you just locked us in. (Sighs) Well, you might as well make yourself comfy, 'cause we're stuck in here till the power comes back on. (Thunder crashes as the scene switches to Doofenshmirtz and Perry sitting in chairs) Ooh, quite a storm, huh? Reminds me of a story Papa Doofenshmirtz used to tell me to scare me into wetting the bed. (Laughs) That prankster! (Camera zooms into him) It began a long time ago with my great-great grandfather, Dr. Jekyll Doofenshmirtz!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Jekyll Doofenshmirtz puts the screw on a machine) (Narrating) He was obsessed with being (Jekyll Doofenshmirtz screws the screw into place) the most evil scientist of his time. Back then, to be considered truly evil, you actually had to have an angry mob after you."
Jameson, Your 11:00 is here.
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," The angry mob?! Ooh, they're early. Show them to the parlor."
Woman, (Sips)
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," Top of the morning, angry mob."
Man," Let's hurry this along, Doctor. We've got a tar-and-feathering at noon."
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," Yes, of course, of course. This time I know I've created something evil enough to warrant your full attention and anger. The Concoction Brew-Inator! A diabolical machine that produces a potion (Turns the Concoction Brew-Inator on) to turn a normal man, (The Concoction Brew-Inator turns off) like myself, (Grabs the cup) into a horrible monster! (Drinks the potion) Now... tremble before me!"
Mob, (Laughing)
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (Seen as a fairy) What? You're not so much trembling. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Come back! (The mob leaves. The last person in the mob closes the door) So you're not an angry mob right now, but... I bet you're slightly irritated, right? I should get points for that! I should get points for that."
Grandpa Reg," Uh, where was I? Oh, yes! Now, the boys had a real monkey on their hands, and they had to get him ready for the big night."
Phineastein," Come on! That-a-boy! Check it out, Ferbgor. (Throws a fish in the Platypus monkey's mouth) To make sure we win that monkey contest, I taught him a few tricks. Watch this. Play dead! (The platypus monkey doesn't move) Huh? Huh?"
Constance," (Still using the quill) So I said, ""Oh no, you di-in't!"" (Growling) And she said-- What was that? (Opens the door) What's going on down there? (Goes down the stairs) I will go straight to the angry mob and tell on you. (Opens another door) Aha!"
Dr. Phineastein," Oh, hi, Constance. (Holds up the Best Monkey Contest poster) We're gonna enter the Best Monkey Contest."
Constance, How are you gonna answer a monkey contest? (The platypus monkey walks behind Constance) You don't even have a monkey!
Platypus monkey, (Growls)
Constance," He's right behind me, isn't he?"
Dr. Phineastein, Yeah!
Constance," (Screams) (Steps back and grabs Dr. Phineastein's shirt) I'm. Telling. Mob. (Runs off, screaming. She comes out of the castle on a bike) Angry mob, come quick! (Stops the bike) Phineastein and Ferbgor have created a giant green monkey!"
Man 2, Didn't you tell us last week that they created a 2-headed cow?
Constance, We're wasting time! (Bikes off) Now let's hurry before the monkey gets away!
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (Back to normal) Jameson, I think I found the problem. I had the Brew-Inator set to ""Fairy Princess"" by mistake. (Turns the dial) You know, in hindsight, I question even including a (Turns on the Concoction Brew-Inator) ""Fairy Princess"" setting to begin with. (The Concoction Brew-Inator whirs then turns off. He grabs the cup) But, you know, live and learn. Cheers! (Drinks the potion) Hmm... Evil has an interesting flavor. I must tell my friend, Dr.-- (He grunts and screams as he turns into a monkey)"
Jameson, Hmm... It actual worked.
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," I know! I'm just as surprised as you are! Put her there, Jameson! Psych! (Laughs) (Jumps a few times) At last! A whole new world of evil has opened up to me! You know what this calls for, don't you?"
Jameson," A rampage, sir?"
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," Exactly! Oh, and clean your uniform. (Laughs) Evil!"
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz, That's me!
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," Well, not a plan so much."
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (While doing rabbit ears on two people having their picture taken) I'm winging it, actually."
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz, That's right.
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz, I don't think that's word.
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," Oops, gotta go. (Chuckles) (Runs to Castle Phineastein) Evil! (Knocks the handle) (Evil laughing) Hyah! Got your nose! (Laughs) I got your... I... I... I really do have his nose. (The platypus monkey is seen without his bill) Oops. Heh. Okay, okay. Well, we'll just put this back. (The platypus monkey is seen with his bill, but slanted) There you go. Good as new."
Platypus monkey, (Growls)
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz, EVIL!!!!
Phineastein, Oh great! (Puts on his hat and jacket) We really have to stop losing our monkeys.
Villager, Blimey! Look what's coming!
Villagers, (Screaming) Run!
Villager 2," (Walks to his balcony, seen wearing only his underwear) I'm finally cured of my irrational fear that a giant platypus will see me in my underpants. (The platypus monkey walks by) It's even worse than I imagined!"
Isabella lookalike, Whatcha doin'?
Dr. Phineastein," Hello? (Bats squeaking) (Camera pans to the inside of the cave, showing three monkeys) Are there any monkeys in there?"
Monkey, Shh.
Dr. Phineastein," No, I guess not."
Constance," It was right here! You have to believe me! A giant platypus! (Mob grumbling) Wait! Mob, look! (Picks up a poster) The Monkey's Ball! (Turns the poster) This is where they must have gone. (They walks out of the castle) Follow me!"
Isabella Lookalike, ♪ La la la la ♪ Whatcha doin'?
Dr. Phineastein, We're looking for a giant platypus monkey. Have you seen one by any chance?
Isabella Lookalike," Funny you should ask. We spent the entire afternoon together. We went swimming, had a little lunch. Did you know he eats raw snails? Ew! I stuck to PB and J on whole wheat."
Dr. Phineastein, Where is he now?
Isabella Lookalike, He went into town to enter the Best Monkey Contest.
Dr. Phineastein, (Grabs Ferbgor and shakes him) Of course that's where he went! What were we thinking? Come on! (They run off)
Isabella Lookalike, Goodbye then! Tell him to save me a dance!
Dr. Phineastein," Thinks for the lift, mister! (He and Ferbgor hop off) Let's go!"
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (Back to normal) Best monster, indeed. Wait till they get a load of pure evil! (Knocks off the punch bowl, cups and drink dispenser and puts the Concoction Brew-Inator on the table) We'll just adjust the dial, and-- (Turns around and notices the platypus monkey. He gasps) Yah!"
Contestant, Monkey fight! (Starts a fight with a contestant dressed like a hippo. Soon everyone else starts fighting)
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (While being slammed on the floor) Really, really, I don't have your nose! Wait wait. Time out. Allow me one little drink before we continue. I'm parched, okay?"
Dr. Phineastein," Here, boy! (At Ferbgor) I hope he hasn't gotten into any trouble."
Jekyll Doofenshmirtz," (Drinks a potion) (Chuckles) Just wait till my potion kicks in, you big, dumb monk-- (Grunts and turns into a fairy) What? But I-- I thought I had it set to-- (Flies to the Concoction Brew-Inator and turns the dial. The platypus monkey grabs him and yelps. 2nd Flashback ends)"
Doofenshmirtz," And, well, I forgot exactly what happens after that. (The lights come back on) Oh, hey, the lights! What do you know? (Gets up and stretches.. Perry also gets up and stretches) Oh, I got no time for my diabolical plan now. I've got the chiropractor at 4:00. (Walks Perry to the door) Could we pick it up tomorrow at, say, my evil scheme monologue? Good! (Camera zooms into him) But, you know, I wonder who actually did win the Best Monkey Contest."
Dr. Phineastein," Oh, there you are, platypus monster. (Camera pans to inside the building) And to think I worried you might get into some mischief."
Host," Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to announce the winner of the Best Monster Contest."
Dr. Phineastein," Hey, we're just in time."
Constance, (Comes out of the building) Mob! It's here! The monkey's in here!
Man, We're coming! Don't get your knickers in a twist.
Constance," (Walks into the building by the Concoction Brew-Inator) They are so busted! (Notices the Concoction Brew-Inator) Oh, refreshments! (Grabs the cup) This monkey hunting is thirsty work. (Drinks a potion) That's a peculiar taste."
Jeremiah," Hey, Constance."
Constance," Oh, Jeremiah!"
Jeremiah," I can't remember a day when you looked more beautiful. (Constance turns into a monkey) Well, now I can."
Host," Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner of the Best Monkey Contest is... (Camera pans to Constance as a spotlight shines on her) That!"
Dr. Phineastein," Way to go, Constance! (Thumbs up) Good show!"
Man, There it is!
Constance," Wait! No, no, no! I'm not the monkey! (She screams, throws the flowers, and then runs through the wall. The mob chases after her)"
Dr. Phineastein," Oh well. (Touches the platypus monkey's hand) Win some, lose some, boy. (Camera zooms into him) You'll always be the biggest, baddest monkey to us."
Isabella Lookalike, (Dressed in her contest outfit) I see you found your giant platypus.
Dr. Phineastein, That's right. And we'll never lose him again.
Grandpa Reg, And that is why there are pumpkins.
Phineas," Um, Grandpa, you were telling us about a giant platypus monkey."
Grandpa Reg," Ooh, that sounds exciting! Tell me about that."
Phineas, But you were-- I mean-- I didn't-- (Sighs) (The lights come back on) I've got nothing. Ferb?
Ferb, Platypus monkeys are the only monkeys to lay eggs.
