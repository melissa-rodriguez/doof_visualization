Phineas," So, what's the plan today, Dad?"
Lawrence," Well, your mother's jazz trio has a gig at the Mayor's Day festivities, and I shall be running the antiques auction, oh yes! I'm very excited because we have a collection of steamrollers on the block, all imported from England."
Candace, You're kidding. There's a market for that?
Lawrence," Oh, you'd be surprised, what with Steamroller Today magazine and Wacky Steamroller videos posted on the Internet. The public is going crazy for the flattening arts."
Candace," Pfff. People and their silly trends. (to Linda) Hey, Mom, can I get a pink streak in my hair?"
Linda, Why would you do that?
Candace, To express my individuality! Everyone's doing it!
Linda," No! (to Lawrence) Alright, well, I'm all set. I've got my lucky guitar strings, wearing my lucky underwear, and, of course, I've got..."
Linda," Oh, no! My lucky gold guitar pick! (Gets down on all fours to peer into the crack) It's wedged in the wall."
Lawrence," Oh, here. Try my lucky butter knife."
Linda," Oh, it's too far in. (Stands) You gave me that for our anniversary."
Lawrence," Oh, don't worry, love. I'll get a contractor in here to retrieve it."
Linda," I hate the idea of someone cutting a hole in my nice wall. Well, I can't worry about it right now. I've got music to make!"
Lawrence," Whoa, yes, we'd better go. See you kids at the festival later, okay?"
Linda, Bye!
Phineas/Candace, Good luck!
Phineas," I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb! Hey! Where's Perry?"
Computer," Computer authorizing DNA, one moment please. Access granted."
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P. How do you like the new spitoon lair entrance? (Beat) Anyway, your mission. Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz is being honored today with a statue at the Mayor's Day Festival. (Background of screen becomes a weather map with Heinz's and Roger's faces on it.) Considering Doofenshmirtz's hatred for his brother, the forecast suggests mild tomfoolery with a sixty percent chance of slapstick violence. Good luck, Agent P. Now on to Tom Perkins with sports."
Phineas," We're done, Ferb."
Isabella, Whatcha doin'?
Phineas, We just built a device that temporarily scrambles your molecules so you can pass through solid objects. Let's see if it works.
Bobbi Fabulous, Now listen up...
Phineas," Hey we almost forgot, we have to get that pick for Mom! I'll be right back. (phases through wall)"
Candace," So I asked Jeremy if he was going to the festival and he's like ""Yeah, are you going to the festival?"" and then I go..."
Candace, Hey...
"Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford", (without looking around) Hey.
Phineas, Got it.
Candace, (drops the apple in her hand in shock) ...Call you back Stacy.
Phineas," (puts ball on the table) Hey Candace, we're heading out to the festival. See ya!"
Candace, (takes out phone and dials) Mom?
Linda, (on stage at the festival) Hello? Candace?
Candace," Mom, I know this sounds crazy. I mean, no crazier than all my other calls. You've got a gig, you're upset about losing your lucky pick. Like, you're going to come home now and see what I'm rambling on about. No, you know, I should bring the ball to you! Yeah that's a good idea. Mom, forget this call ever happened. Bye! (hangs up)"
Linda, (deafened by the music) What?
Doofenshmirtz," (talking to a Perry bobblehead) You see bobblehead Perry the Platypus, I have created a powerful -inator that will deface anything it contacts! Including my brother Roger's statue that's being unveiled at today's festival. It's going to humiliate him! Isn't that genius, bobblehead Perry the Platypus? (flicks the bobblehead)"
Doofenshmirtz," (seeing the bobblehead bounce) Oh yes, so you agree. You know, I miss our little talks, don't you? Oh, what do you know anyway? (throws bobblehead out the back window)"
Candace, (picks up the phasing ball) Walk through walls eh?
Candace," Okay, now I'm mad. (activates the ball and walks through the wall) You've outdone yourselves boys. Wait 'til Mom sees this."
Roger Doofenshmirtz," Citizens of Danville, it is an honor to be your mayor and a pleasure to serve."
Doofenshmirtz," (getting out of the microbus) Oh, no, Roger, it is I who will be serving you."
Doofenshmirtz," Hm... okay, push up and..."
Doofenshmirtz," Those are my keys, aren't they? (On the phone) No, I don't have my card. Yes, the keys are still in there and it's running. (Engine shudders to a stop.) Okay, now it's not running; now I need gas... Forty-five minutes huh?... (Sighs) Well I'm not going anywhere. (Puts phone away) Eh, well at least I can get my -inator. (Aims the -inator.)"
Roger Doofenshmirtz, As we get closer to unveiling this perfect replica of my body...
Doofenshmirtz, Perry the Plat...! (gets punched by Perry) Hey!
Doofenshmirtz, What? That's a... it's an arts and crafts project! I've got a life outside of you!
Doofenshmirtz, Curse you Perry the bobblehead!
Isabella," Oh no! Bummer, I have a flat!"
Phineas," No problem, we can fix it."
Lawrence," And now, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting to bid on. I give you, the antique steamrollers! (crowd cheers)"
Crowd member, They're so beautiful! (cries)
Wilbur Wilkins, Steamrollers stink!
Orville Wilkins," Yeah, pump trolleys rule!"
Old lady, (gasps) It's the Wilkins brothers!
Old man, Just ignore them Arlene. They try to cause trouble at every steam-powered antique auction in the Tri-State Area.
Lawrence, Shall we start the bidding?
Phineas, Hey Candace!
Candace," Enjoy your last moments of freedom, boys!"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, you might have destroyed Plan A, but behold! (Another -inator rises from the bus) Plan B! (Pushes a button and the -inator explodes) Which I have just destroyed, so now we're even. But not even I am prepared for Plan C! (Third -inator rises from the flatbed) Behold! The Be-Gone-Inator! How do you like me now Perry the Gone-a-pus?"
Doofenshmirtz," Eh, so I missed. Oh whatever, I have a bigger bother to be-gone. Goodbye, stupid Roger statue!"
Lawrence, And Lot Number 2 is a little beaut from Aveling & Porter built in 1924. Do I have any bids?
Crowd, I do! I do! I do! Here!
Orville Wilkins, Nobody's paying a lick of attention to us Wilbur.
Wilbur Wilkins, Yeah! Let's get out of here.
Baljeet, (Impatiently) So how long does it take you to fix a flat? Tick tock!
Candace, (Running through the festival) Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through!
Baljeet," Aghh! You can build a rollercoaster in a day, but it takes you 12 minutes to pump up a tire?"
Baljeet, Did anybody else just see the inside of a steamroller?
Buford, How do you know what the inside of a steamroller looks like?
Baljeet, I have a life outside of you!
Phineas," Well, the tire's fixed."
Lawrence, And Lot Number 5 is sold to the woman in red. And now the last item of the day: we have Lot 6. Do I have any bids?
Candace," (struggling to get the door off of the porta potty stall, while Balthazar gives her a high five) Mom!"
Candace, Mom!
Doofenshmirtz, Hmm... what are the odds?
Phineas, Hey mom! I'm glad we caught you. Ferb and I found your lucky gold pick.
Linda, Oh boys! Thank you! What a relief; I just hate playing without it.
Candace, Mom! Mom! Look at this! Look at me!
Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro, Linda! We're on!
Candace, Mom!
Linda," Candace, I've gotta go. And just because I won't let you get pink hair, you don't have to wear some weird door. The trends these days..."
Candace," But, but!"
Phineas, (walking away) Cool door Candace. (to the others) Let's get a good spot.
Buford," I'd wear a door. Heck, I'd even wear a window if it'd fit."
Jeremy, (walking past the group) Hey guys.
Candace, Oh no! Jeremy!
Jeremy, You seen Candace?
Phineas, She's standing in the door.
Jeremy, Thanks.
Candace, Oh no! Oh no! Jeremy can't see me like this. Oh my g..! Oh no! (winds the door's toilet paper around her head)
Jeremy, Candace?
Candace," ...and four. And breathe. Whew, just doing some stretching. Oh hi Jeremy!"
Jeremy," So, our moms are going to start playing when they unveil the statue. Wanna go?"
Candace, (dreamily) Sure.
Roger Doofenshmirtz," And now, without further ado! (Statue is unveiled; crowd cheers; band starts playing.)"
Phineas," Well Ferb, it looks like everything worked out for everyone today."
Doofenshmirtz," (standing with Perry on his flatbed, balanced on the edge of the cliff) I can't believe nothing worked out for me today. After... I.. I had a A, B, and C and they all... 'course I destroyed the B so..."
Doofenshmirtz, Hey where are you going? Curse you Perry the Platypus! (Rolls past the Wilkins brothers)
Wilbur Wilkins, Hey look at that! A pump-less pump trolley!
Orville Wilkins, Now that's old school.
