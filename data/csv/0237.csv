Phineas, We're slowing down.
Phineas, I...see...why...dogs...enjoy...this...sensation!!!!!
Candace, Delayed?! What do you mean delayed?
Linda," Candace honey, the snowstorm has delayed your grandparents' plane. Your father and I have to wait here at the airport until they arrive. It may be hours."
Candace, But I need your help! Stacy told me that Marcus told her that Jeremy told him that he got the perfect gift for me!
Linda," Oh no, how will you manage?"
Candace," Mom, think! If Jeremy found the perfect gift for me, then I have to find the perfect gift for him!"
Linda, I thought you already got a gift for Jeremy.
Candace," I did, but I can't show up with an obvious, stupid present that anyone could've gotten him. The perfect gift means that you totally get the other person in the most deep and paying-attention-y way. If his gift to me is perfect and my gift to him isn't, he's gonna be so hurt and insulted, and think I'm lame and thoughtless, and he'll stop liking me! [sobs]"
Linda," Oh, Candace honey, I don't think-- You poor thing. Forgive me, boys. What are your brothers up to?"
Candace," Not a thing. Which is weird...what are they up to...? Love you, mom, gotta run, bye!"
Phineas, Plow!
Candace, (grinning widely)
Phineas, House!
Phineas, We're coming in too fast!
Phineas, We've been working on a way to seize the day while also not having to get out of bed so early. I think we can cross that one off our to-do list.
Candace," Lemmie see that. What is this? Number one was ""Write letters to Santa."" What, did you start this to-do list when you were three years old?!"
Phineas, We write letters to Santa Claus every year. Don't you?
Candace, Wah-hahahaha! Letters to Santa? Ahahahaha! That's for little kids! Hahaha!
Phineas," Santa's not just for little kids, Candace."
Candace," Okay, fine. Let's assume there is a Santa Claus."
Phineas," Well of course there is. There's been a ton of reported sightings. Oregon, 1978. Northern Scotland, 1954. The so-called Santa Cloth found in Istanbul, 1912."
Phineas," Santa's one of our biggest heroes. Talk about making the most out of one day. Imagine flying around the whole world, delivering toys and gifts to everybody in one night. Ferb and I have done some cool stuff in our time, but that, that's something else."
Candace," Again, let's assume there is a Santa Claus. He's got it easy. The hard part is trying to figure out what to get people want when they don't write you a letter, telling you exactly what they want most. And by ""people"" I mean ""Jeremy"", and by ""you"", I mean ""me""... and uh, no the rest is pretty much literal."
Phineas, Well I'm sure Jeremy would get exactly what he wanted. If he wrote his own letter to Santa.
Candace," Bwahahaha, letters to Santa!? (Laughs) That's for little kids. (Laughs)"
Phineas, Wow. She's lapped us.
Candace," Wait that's it! I'll trick Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa, so I can sneak a peek and learn what he wants straight from the horse's mouth. And by ""mouth"" I mean ""pen"", and by ""horse"" I mean Jeremy, and... yeah we're good."
Phineas, Or you could ask him directly what he wants to avoid any unnecessary complications.
Candace, You are such a child sometimes. (She leaves the boys' room)
Phineas," You know, Ferb, just think of all the wonderful things Santa does for us, and he never asks for anything in return. Wait, that's it! Ferb, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Phineas," As usual, we're...Oh! Ugh! Man, no, that's not at all what I was thinking! Oh! Dude!"
Phineas," Oh. Yeah. That's it. I'll call in the troops, you wonder where Perry is."
Snowman," Hello! Wintertime's fun! Follow me! (Motions to Perry, begins to walk toward the road. Perry follows him.) Come on! Follow me! ...plow!!!"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P. there you are. Merry Christmas. Oh great, you brought snacks."
Major Monogram," Wintertime's fun, follow me."
Carl," Secret Santa time. Agent P. Ah, here you are."
Carl," Oh, a ""Sal Tuscany Christmas"". You lucked out, Agent P. Your secret Santa has exquisite taste."
Major Monogram," (Glaring) Criminy, Carl. It's supposed to be a secret Santa."
Carl, What? No! I didn't get it for him.
Major Monogram," Huh, right. (Chuckles)"
Carl," No, really I didn't!"
Major Monogram," The more you protest, the more we know you gave it to him."
Carl, Fine! Think what you want! Whatever! (Huffs in anger)
Major Monogram," Okay, Scrooge. We got it."
Major Monogram," Uh-oh, sorry Agent P. I guess evil never takes a holiday. If you'll direct your attention to the screen. Good morning Agent P. A wise man once said... eyes on the screen."
Major Monogram," A wise man once said, ""Evil never takes a holiday"". We don't know what Doofenshmirtz is up to. But he's evil, and evil people hate Christmas. It's a cliche, sad cliche. Good luck, Agent P, and Merry Christmas."
Major Monogram," Carl! Stop filming your butt, film mine. It's a party!"
Jeremy, Hello?
Candace," Happy Christmas Eve, my little drummer boy."
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. You know I don't play drums. I play guitar."
Candace," I know silly-billy. So, Whatcha doin?"
Jeremy, Not sleeping anymore. How 'bout you?
Candace," I just thought it was the perfect day to show some Christmas spirit. Like when you were young and wrote letters to Santa... (Phineas and Ferb are seen hosting some of their thing to thank Santa) Would you keep that lame junk away from my window!? (to Jeremy) I'm sorry, what was I saying?"
Jeremy, ...Writing letters to Santa Claus?
Candace," Bwahahaha, letters to Santa!? Oh! Brilliant idea. Let's get together and write letters to Santa, and be very specific, within a reasonable price range. For fun. I'll be over in a bit."
Jeremy," Candace, this isn't one of these thing..."
Candace," Hehehe, he doesn't suspect a thing. (pause) I just hope this works... (sits on her bed) 'Cause I don't have a clue."

Phineas, Awesome! Phase one complete. Hey guys.
Buford, Cool clubhouse.
Phineas," Oh, no. This is not how you would say a ""clubhouse"". This is the ultimate rest and relaxation lounge, perfectly tailored to the jolly, rubenesque world traveler. (Awkward pause) It's a rest stop for Santa."
Isabella," Oh, I see."
Baljeet," Oh, why did you not just say that?"
Phineas," Highlights include: sauna, massage table, satellite television, elliptical machine to work off all the milk and cookies, milk and cookies, reindeer feeding station, and of course, beard purifier. But this is only the beginning. Remember when you wrote letters to Santa asking him for presents?"
Isabella/Buford/Baljeet, Yes.
Candace, (from inside) BWAH HA HA HA HA! LETTERS TO SANTA!?! AH HA HA!!
Phineas, Did you always get the presents you asked for?
Isabella/Buford/Baljeet," Pretty much, yes!"
Phineas, Of course. Now did you ever write a thank-you note to Santa?
Isabella/Buford/Baljeet," Well, no, but...nobody ever told... (sighs) no."
Phineas," Well, I think it's time someone did something cool for Santa to show him we appreciate everything he does for us. So we're gonna turn the entire city of Danville into a giant, shimmering thank-you card for Santa Claus."
Buford, So what you're saying is it's not a clubhouse.
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus. I have a present for you. And by ""present,"" of course, I mean ""trap."" (Perry is wrapped in Christmas lights) Aw, look how festive you are. Wait, wait, hold on. (Puts a partridge on Perry's bill) ♪ And a partridge on a Perry ♪ ... the Platypus! Now, Perry the Platypus, behold! The Naughty-inator! When activated, the naughty nectar in these giant glass cylinders will create a massive charged cloud of pure naughtiness. When Santa then makes his list, and checks it twice, everyone in the Tri-State Area will appear to be naughty instead of nice! And no nice equals no Santa equals no Christmas. There's just one tiny, little blemish on my otherwise perfect plan. I don't actually have a problem with Christmas. There's no tragic holiday-related back-story in my past. Christmas was always fine growing up. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible. You see, unlike every other evil scientist, I don't hate Christmas. There are plenty of other holidays I can't stand. ♪ For example... ♪ Wait, wait, hold on. I can't get this— ♪ Uh, for example... ♪"
Doofenshmirtz, ♪ You see Valentine's is torture and my birthday is a mess ♪
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, what the heck. Kickline!"
Doofenshmirtz, I have an intense BURNING indifference!
Doofenshmirtz," I didn't even create the Naughty-inator myself because I compulsively, obsessively, just couldn't be bothered. Nah, the plans were mailed to me from Borneo where my Uncle Justin is rumored to be in hiding. It's really a sweet gift, but how can I destroy Christmas without having a good reason? (sighs) Well, I guess I have no choice. (Presses a button and a chair pops out of the ground and he flops in it) But to sit and wait for a reason."

Jeremy," Hey, in a minute Candace. I'm right in the middle of something here. I was thinking you could maybe help me finish decorating. First."
Candace," No! It'll be too late! The stores will all be closed! And by ""stores"" I mean ""the post office"", and ""by buying a gift"", I mean ""mailing the letters""."
Jeremy," You didn't say ""buying a gift""."

Well, if that's how things are, I have my reasons to push this button. So long, Christmas, you're Feliz Navi-dead to me! (Pushes button) (chuckles) See? Uh, it was Spanish."

Old Caroler, Can I at least get a diet soda?
Blay'n, What do we have here? Oh! Tsk! Tsk!
Clewn't, Oh Blay'n. Oop! What do you have there?
Blay'n," Oh just a bunch of last minute naughties. It's a shame, huh Clewn't?"
Clewn't, Kids! They get worse every year. Ungrateful little... I'll go sit in the dark and mutter to myself.
Burdensome elf," He wasn't always that way. In fact, he used to love kids. In fact, he used to be where the action is. Toy making. In fact, he was the fastest, best toymaker of them all. In fact, they used to call him ""Clewn't, the fastest, best toymaker of them all."" Though they just called him ""Clewn't"" for short, which also happens to be his name so the nickname thing was a kind of a moot point. In fact... (The camera zooms out to see Blay'n gone) ""Just go up and talk to the first person you see. That's how you make friends."" I'm never going to another seminar."
Candace," Okay, listen, you twerps. Your ridiculous efforts to thank Santa Claus are getting in the way of my ridiculous efforts to get Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa Claus. So why don't you... Hey, what's with the clouds?"
Phineas," Whoa! Is it me, or does the sky look really dark and ominous, as if its foreshadowing events which will have a negative impact on our lives."
Mailman," I'm sorry kids, looks like everyone in Danville got a return on their letters to Santa. They've all been stamped ""naughty""."
Phineas, What?
Jeremy," Hey, Candace, look! I did it. I wrote a letter to Santa saying in great detail what gift I want most."
Candace, Cool! Thank you my Little Town of Bethlehem. I'll just hang onto that for you.
Mailman," Oh, I'll take that buddy. Maybe you'll have better luck with Santa than your friends."
Candace," But, but... uhh!"
Phineas, Santa thinks everybody in Danville's been naughty.
Buford, Now that's just nonsense.
Phineas," But, but how can that be."
Candace," Oh, well, let's see. What's different this year than last year? Oh, I know! You went out and got everyone in Danville involved in one of your off-the-cuff, harebrained schemes."
Phineas, You think this could be my fault?
Candace," Oh, who can say really? But, sometimes, we do naughty things without having any idea they're naughty. Sometimes we do an entire summer's worth of them. (glares at Phineas)"
Phineas, Could this be true?
Isabella/Buford/Baljeet, Oh no...I mean how could...well I guess it...
Isabella/Buford, Maybe.
Baljeet, I am cold.
Baljeet,Act III
Anchorman," This is Gordon Gutsofanemu reporting from the Googolplex Mall here in downtown Danville. The Christmas all but banished ever since Santa Claus stamped big red ""naughty"" across this once nice city."
Phineas, (gasp) It was all a bad dream! Christmas wasn't cancelled!
Isabella," Phineas! No matter how many times you try that, it's not going to work."
Phineas," Maybe if I hadn't gotten out of bed today, I wouldn't have done the things Santa thought was naughty."
Isabella," So, what? Are you going to stay here for the rest of your life?"
Phineas, Why not?
Isabella," Well, for one, the mall closes in twenty minutes."
Buford," I don't see what everyone's so worried about. I got this system, see? You act any way you want all year long, but then right before Christmas, you do one big act selfless act of kindness and Santa will wipe your slate clean. Works like a charm."
Baljeet, Really? So I might still have my one big Christmas wish come true?
Buford, Maybe.
Baljeet, Are you not going ask me what my Christmas wish is?
Buford," Nope. It'll only wanna make me hurt you, which will counteract my one act of kindness."
Baljeet," All I want is one sweet, special Christmas kiss under the mistletoe."

Phineas," That's not fire, it's steam! Come on!"
Baljeet, Hey look! Someone is using your clubhouse!
Phineas," Come on, let's check it out!"
Phineas, I don't believe it! Santa!
Blay'n," Uh, sir, what are you doing here?"
Santa, Having a shvitz. Steam is just what the doctor ordered.
Phineas, We thought you weren't coming to Danville.
Santa, And pass up on enjoying this cool rest stop you made me? Ho! Ho! Ho! Unthinkable! And thanks for doing the Danville run for me.
Phineas, You knew?
Santa, Of course I knew! I'm Santa Claus!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh what a mess. Curse you, Sal Tuscany! (smashes the CD) Well, I probably should call Uncle Justin and thank him for the gift anyway. Hello, operator? I would like to place a call to... Barneo? I thought it said Borneo. Wait, where's Barneo? The North Pole! Wait a second! The letters of ""A Sal Tuscany Christmas"" spell ""Santa Claus"" with an embarrassing leftover ""Y"". Let me see that picture. Sal Tuscany is Santa Claus?"
Candace, Ah! Jeremy! I was just coming to see you.
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. I don't know what that was all about before, but I wanted to give you your present."
Candace," (gasps) The earrings I wanted. Jeremy, how did you know?"
Jeremy, I remember you loved them in that magazine. And you were even gonna have your good necklace made into a pair like them.
Candace, That's so sweet. How did you afford these?
Jeremy, I sold my electric.
Candace," Oh, Jeremy. You were gonna trade that in to get that cool, new silver one."
Jeremy, You knew that?
Candace," I guess I know you as well as you know me, my bowl full of jelly. Here's your gift."
Jeremy, The silver guitar! But how?
Candace, I sold my good necklace.
Candace/Jeremy, It's perfect.
Jeremy, Merry Christmas.
Candace, Merry Christmas.
Baljeet, Funny how things worked out so that everyone pretty much got what they wanted.
Isabella," What did you wish for, Phineas?"
Santa, May I do the honors? I like this one.
Phineas, Okay.
Santa," ""Dear Santa, you are one of my biggest heroes. All I want for Christmas this year is a chance to be like you. Thank you, Phineas Flynn."" Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas, Phineas. And by the way, good job."
Blay'n, Yeah!
Isabella," Yeah, that was fun."
Baljeet, Good job.
Santa," Well, kids, it's time for me to head home. So you're sure you don't need this?"
Phineas," No, we made it for you."
Santa," Great! I'll take it to the North Pole, and use it as a clubhouse."
Buford, I knew it was a club house.
Blay'n, Goodbye!
Baljeet," Goodbye Blay'n, Clewn't. Merry Christmas!"
Isabella, See you guys. Thanks Blay'n. Thanks Clewn't.
Buford, Merry Christmas to ya.
Clewn't, So long. And... thanks.
Phineas," Wait, Santa! It's true isn't it? You planned everything so everyone's Christmas wish would come true."
Santa," Well, Santa's gotta have a little fun. (starts to fly off) Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!"
Phineas," Oh wait! Ferb, what did you wish for?"
Ferb, Take a look at this morning's paper.
Phineas," ""World peace""?"
Ferb," No, no, this one down here."
Phineas," ""Local boy gets harmonica""! Hey, great picture!"
Candace," Hey, Mom and Dad are back."
Reginald, Hey kiddies! Merry Christmas.
Phineas, Grandma! Grandpa! You made it!
Candace, Merry Christmas.
Winifred, I made figgy pudding.
