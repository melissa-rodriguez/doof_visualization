Phineas," What to do, what to do?"
Isabella," Hi, guys. What'cha doin'?"
Phineas," Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. Hey, are you Fireside Girls missing any specific accomplishment patches?"
Isabella," Let's see. What's next on the list? (reads a list of patches until she comes to the right one; snaps fingers) ""Rodeo Clown"" patch!"
Baljeet, What does a rodeo clown do?
Buford," They keep the bulls from knockin' you over, like this! (knocks Baljeet over)"
Baljeet," Oh, I can see how that would be helpful."
Phineas," We can build mechanical bulls and have a robot rodeo. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P. Seems the Tri-State Area's association of evil geniuses, the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness, is having some sort of huge gathering. All of the other agents have been deployed, but none have reported back. We fear they've been captured. Now, see what you can do, Agent P. (salutes) Monogram out."
Candace, Tiny Cowboy live in concert!
Stacy," Um, Candace? Candace?!"
Candace, Tiny Cowboy is our favorite band ever! AHH!
Stacy, CANDACE! I can't go.
Candace, Wha...?
Stacy, It...it's my mom. She doesn't want me to go to the concert with you.
Candace, What? Doesn't she like me?
Stacy," No, no. She likes you just fine, she just thinks...you're, I don't know, flighty and unfocused from time to time."
Candace," ""Unfocused""? What could possibly give her that... (hears motor whirring) Wait, did... did you hear that? Was that Ferb's band-saw?"
Stacy, Candace?
Candace, Yes?
Stacy, Focus.
Candace," Oh, yeah, right."
Stacy," Mom said if I'm going to a grown-up concert, she wants me to go with someone more...grounded and mature."
Candace, I can be grounded and mature.
Stacy, Really?
Candace," Well, I can certainly fake it long enough to convince your mom. Remember that time I pretended to be Irish for a whole week?"
Stacy," Indeed I do, Miss O'Flynn!"
Candace, We can do this!
Candace/Stacy, AHHHHH!
Judge," Welcome, one and all, to the second annual Inator Creator contest. And now, please welcome last year's winner, Rodney!"
Rodney," Thank you. Feast your eyes, boys. (reveals trophy belt) Ta-daaaa!"
Rodney, Look upon this belt of victory.
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, I'm taking that puppy home with me, 'cause I'll have a greater Inator this year. Not a greater, it's...I-I'm not gonna break a block of cheese and make nachos for you guys. It's-it's greater in the sense that it's better than it was last year. (pause, walks away) That's what I mean."
Stacy," All right, let's concentrate on your look. Ta-da!"
Candace, (wearing fake glasses) But... they're just a pair of fake glasses.
Stacy, Exactly. Nothing says real focus like fake glasses.
Candace, What's that?
Ferb," (in the background) Cowgirls and cowpokes, welcome to the Flynn-Fletcher Bros' Rodeo!"
Candace, Wait a minute! What's going on out there?
Stacy, Candace?
Candace, They'd better not be... (gasps) Feeling...busting...urge!
Stacy," Easy, girl."
Phineas," Great job on these cowboy hat helmets, Ferb."
Candace, A rodeo?! (dials phone) Got tell Mom!
Stacy, Wait. Following all over yourself to bust your brothers is exactly what makes you look so flighty and unfocused.
Candace, I must repress my basic urges to bust.
Stacy," Repressing basic urges to bust is pretty responsible, isn't it?"
Candace, Is it ever! Look at my mom!
Linda, Cake is a sometimes food. Cake is a sometimes food.
Ferb," All right, cowboys and cowgirls, it's time to get along, little doggy. Or even a short little doggy. I'm here all week. Try the veal!"
Doofenshmirtz," Finally, Perry the Platypus! All the other animal agents were here on time before they got captured. I'm just saying. It's embarrassing. Anyway, join your friends in the inhospitality suite! (tosses Perry into metal container) Ha ha! Oh, and Perry the..."
Rodney," Heinz, stop monologuing with your nemesis and show us that supposed Inator of yours already! (to his cronies) Doofy rented a private room off the convention floor, because he's still working on his! (they laugh)"
Doofenshmirtz," Laugh enough, now, Rodney, but soon, you'll be crying like a...uh, like a...like a...something that's cries."
Rodney, Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo!
Doofenshmirtz," OH, he makes me so angry! I'm... uh, because he's so right! I need time to finish my Inator! All I've got so far is the fog machine and that's just to add some ""pizazz"" to the presentation. I could turn it on and fog out the whole contest, but all that would do is buy me some time...hey!"
Stacy," Okay, shoulders back."
Candace, Check!
Stacy, Steady walk?
Candace, Check.
Stacy, Serious look.
Candace," Check! Uh, Stacy?"
Stacy, Yes?
Candace, I'm feeling the busting urge.
Phineas," Howdy, Candace! Enjoying the rodeo?"
Candace, Uhhhh!
Stacy," Eyes on the prize, Candace, stay in character."
Linda, I'm sure your mom let you go to a concert by yourself when you were a teenager.
Dr. Hirano, Mmm...no.
Candace," Ahem. Good afternoon, Mother. Good afternoon, Dr. Hirano. Pardon the interruption, but is there any tediously responsible errand of a focused and mature nature that I can perform for you? Balance a checkbook, pay the bills, perhaps file some taxes?"
Linda, Why do I feel that all of this has something to do with busting your brothers?
Candace," What?! (hears mechanical bull) Eh-heh, no. That would be childish of me."
Stacy, You see? Candace level-headed and responsible. She's not a bit worried about what Phineas and Ferb are doing right now.
Candace," (hears mechanical bull) What?! Yes! No, yes, I mean, i-if a responsible focused person..."
Stacy, Like Candace...
Candace," Were to see her brothers engaged in some potential reckless activity,... (gets elbowed) Ow! THAT was childish."
Man 1, There's no case to ruin it whatsoever!
Man 2, This is hideous.
Baljeet, It is getting pretty foggy. Should we call the rodeo off?
Phineas," Nah, we'll just incorporate it and have a foggy robot rodeo! YEE-HAW! Ride 'em, cowboy!"
Baljeet, Ride 'em where?
Buford, You should see what I'm doin'!
Isabella, This fog is making my hair frizzy!
Stacy," It's so nice to sit and be responsible for a change. Just...focused, you know? And Candace and I were thinking that, oh, a live musical event might be a good opportunity for us to really..."
Candace, Ma...ma...m-m-m-m-m...
Stacy, Candace? Tiny Cowboy.
Candace, Ma... ma...
Stacy," (whispering) Candace, the concert!"
Candace," I can't help myself! MOM! PHINEAS AND FERB BUILT A RODEO IN THE BACKYARD WITH MECHANICAL BULLS AND BLEACHERS AND IS REALLY DANGEROUS! COME ON, YOU GOTTA BUST THEM! (drags Linda with her)"
Dr. Hirano, This even I have to see.
Candace, (opening door) Come on... hey! What happened to Danville?
Linda, That's quite a fog bank.
Candace," (blows) Follow me, come on, come on. This way, ladies. Pick up the pace!"
Linda," Candace, slow down!"
Doofenshmirtz," Focus, must finish Inator. (hears applause) Wha... what's all that noise out there? I don't get it, what... what's there to applaud? My fog machine should've obscured everyone's Inators. What could it be..."
Rodney," I give you, the Fog Clearer-Inator!"
Judge," Once again, Rodney gives us just what we need, just when we need it. That puts him in the lead."
Doofenshmirtz, WHAT!? An electric fan? I knew I could beat that if I just had a little more time! (sighs) Wait! (Stares at the Agent Containment Unit)
Linda," Candace, we've been walking forever! Where's the backyard?"
Candace," Hmm... (sniffs, licks, sniffs again) That way! I can smell Phineas and Ferb!"
Dr. Hirano, And what exactly do they smell like?
Candace, Motor oil and competence!
Buford, Hey! Oh! Heyhey!
Phineas," What's wrong, Buford?"
Buford," I don't know, something's making my bull go whacko!"
Scientist 1, The animal agents are free!
Scientist 2, My Inator! How disquieting!
Scientist 3," No, Agent C!"
Scientist 3," Oh, my Mom's gonna kill me-e-e!"
Rodney," No, it's just an electric fan! It's been official to mankind!"
Rodney, Heh heh heh.
Buford, That balloon! It's making the bulls angry!
Phineas," Hey, kid, you think you can let go of that balloon?"
Kid, This balloon cost me fifty cents!
Audience, LET GO OF THE BALLOON!
Candace, Mom! Mom! The fog is lifting! (enters backyard) Aha! (fog lifts fully) Uh...rodeo? Bu--bu-bu-bu-but the... there was an... and I saw... a-and the bulls...
Phineas," Hey, Candace."
Stacy," Well, so much for Tiny Cowboy."
Dr. Hirano," Ohhhh, you can go to the concert. Candace's single-minded determination to bust her brothers shows focus. Something she hopes rubs off on you, young lady."
Rodney," Doofenshmirtz, I see you finally managed to cobble something together. What do you call it? A...Later-inator? (sarcastic laugh)"
Doofenshmirtz," Noooo, I give you...the Eradicate Rodney's-Inator-inator!"
Rodney, What?! No fair! (sobs)
Doofenshmirtz," LIKE A BABY! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! That's what I was looking for. AND... IT'S THE LAST INATOR STANDING!"
Judge, Doofenshmirtz wins by default!
Doofenshmirtz," By default, my favorite way to win!"
Judge," Unfortunately, the trophy belt was destroyed in the fight. So...uh, oh! (grabs the balloon that just floated by) Here, take this balloon instead."
Doofenshmirtz," (takes the balloon) Eh, a prize is a prize. (at the balloon) I'm going to call you...Balloony II. (hears mooing) What's that?"
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry."
Isabella," Well, this was fun, but I'm gonna go wash my hair, now."
Isabella, It's because of the humidity!
