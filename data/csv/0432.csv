Adrian, (voiceover) Welcome to the 48th Montevillebad Grand Prix Pre-Race Show.
Lawrence," Linda, darling, it's starting!"
Nigel," Coming to you, of course, from the coast of glorious Montevillebad."
Ian," A name that translates roughly as ""mountain village bath"" in a variety of European languages."
Linda," Seven hours of racing jargon and mindless statistics, here we come!"
Lawrence," Ooh, snacks!"
Linda," Mm-hmm, and they're race themed."
Lawrence," Well, vroom vroom!"
Nigel," And there's our pole-sitter, international racing legend, Paolo Vanderbeek."
Ian, A household name. Born in the Scottish enclave of a Swiss town in the Italian alps to Dutch parents.
Adrian," Not only a king among drivers, Paolo Vanderbeek is also a beloved man of the people."
Ian," No one is more passionate about his sport or cares more about his fans than Paolo Vanderbeek, earning him the name ""the King of Care."""
Candace," ♪ Gonna go get my bust on, ♪"
Lawrence, How can ya go outside when it's Grand Prix Day?
Candace," (sarcastically) Uh, yeah, well, my pleather jumpsuit is at the cleaners and I feel underdressed."
Lawrence," Oh, that's understandable then."
Linda," She was being facetious, dear."
Lawrence," Oh, I see."
Candace," Well, doesn't look like there's anything bustable going on yet. (takes a seat) I guess I could kill a few."
Linda," Give it a chance, Candace. You might find it exciting."
Adrian," Let's look at an incomprehensible map of the race course, shall we?"
Nigel, (offscreen) I can't make heads or tails out of it. You?
Ian," (offscreen) Uh, no clue, but no doubt, it'll be exciting!"
Candace," (sarcastically) Oh, yeah. The excitement is killing me. Seems like a good time to wonder where Perry is."
Major Monogram," Greetings from Montevillebad, Agent P! You'll be joining us here for your mission. (whispering) But the lines aren't secure. (normal voice) So, we'll give you the details when you get here. And to get you here in style, we've provided you with a vintage 1963 Olson Martin! (The car rises from the floor behind Perry. He smiles.) So I'll see you after the wipe."
Caption, Montevillebad...After the wipe (Cut to Perry now wearing a tux in the car. A monitor showing Monogram's image appears on the dashboard.)
Major Monogram," Hello again, Agent P. International intel has indicated that Doofenshmirtz is planning to sabotage Paolo Vanderbeek and enter the Grand Prix himself. (Cut to Perry driving.) So, we need you to find out what Doof is up to while Carl and I keep an eye on Vanderbeek here at the race track incognito. (Cut to Monogram, now wearing a fake black mustache.) Nifty disguise, huh? Gives me a continental look, don't you think? Anyway, Doofenshmirtz is at the casino L'Hotel Uber-Swank."
Croupier, Monsieur in the lab coat and bow tie wins again.
Doofenshmirtz," Man, I am on a roll!"
Agent Double 0-0, (gets up) Stupid game. I'll never play it again.
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, never say never! Who's next? (Cut to Perry who takes a stick of bubblegum and chews it seriously and blows a bubble.) Oh, a mysterious platypus to take my challenge. Okay, I'll go first."
Croupier, Jeu de morpion! Monsieur Platypus in the tuxedo wins!
Doofenshmirtz, What?!
Bouncer," Monsieur, there are no pets allowed in the casino."
Doofenshmirtz," What? He's not my mysterious platypus. I didn't bring him in here! I just—Oh, oh, you mean the cat. (Doof takes a white cat from under the table and leaves.) Yeah, my bad."
Adrian, Look at all those cars in a line.
Nigel, The collective amount of horsepower is absolutely staggering.
Ian, And so (coughs) are the exhaust fumes.
Candace, You realize this is just a bunch of cars parked in a line.
Linda and Lawrence, Yes. Yes we do.
Doofenshmirtz," (gasp) The mysterious platypus from the casino! (Perry puts on his fedora.) Perry the Mysterious Platypus from the Casino?!?!? Betcha tired of standing 'round, aren't you? (Doof pushes a button and traps Perry in a pile of tires.) See? Tires. I thought it apropos, you know, this being the Grand Prix and all. Wait 'till you see my new lair! (The yacht drives into a cave tunnel.) Not too shabby. Hey, Norm, I'm back!"
Norm, Look what I found! Metal teeth!
Doofenshmirtz," Uch, you've always had metal teeth, Norm."
Norm," Yes, but these are sharp."
Doofenshmirtz," What does that matter? You can't open your mouth. Here, grab Perry the Platypus. Isn't this place fabulous? I found it through an international lair exchange website. It's even got its own rocket. Y'know, I think I might've gotten the better end of this deal."
Doofenshmirtz," Anyway, you're gonna love it. I was so impressed, I commissioned a whole new jingle!"
Singer, ♪ Doofenshmirtz Swanky New Evil Lair! ♪
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, it's swanky!"
Singer," ♪ It's an even swap, ♪"
Doofenshmirtz," (dancing) Yeah, look at these swanky moves!"
Singer, ♪ Vacation swap! ♪
Doofenshmirtz," Thanks, Cheryl! (to the viewer) My real estate agent. (to Perry) So, my evil plan. As you may know, the Montevillebad Grand Prix is a goodwill event with all the prize money awarded to the winner's favorite charity. So, I entered the race for my favorite charity, Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated...namely me! I'm the Doofenshmirtz...in Doofenshmirtz Evil...Well, you get it. And check it out! (Shows his race car on the monitor.) I've re-engineered my Boomshlaka 320-I to meet the Grand Prix specs. I also added some extras that should take care of, like, 99% of the playing field. But then there's still that 1%, Paolo Vanderbeek. But, uh, I got something else to take care of him. Behold, my I-Don't-Care-inator! (beat) It's not that I don't care. It creates apathy in whoever it hits. It's a little esoteric, I know, but, trust me, it'll work. I'll just zap Paolo with this baby and suddenly he won't care about anything and, uh, least of all, racing. I'll turn the King of Care into the King of I Couldn't Care Less, which will pave the way for me to win the race and the prize money for my favorite charity, which, I think I said before, is me. Now, before I go, lest you try to escape, I'll show you one more feature of this place. (He presses a button that says ""Shark Tank"".) Look, it's got its own shark tank! (laughter) (Cut to Norm wearing a rocket helmet. Doof straps into a seat on the robot.) Okay, then, I'm off to the races...literally! (Norm launches.) Hasta la pasta, baby!"
Adrian," Welcome back, racing fans, to the Montevillebad Grand Prix. And the teams are making the final preparations before the start of the race."
Ian," Including our favorite, Paolo Vanderbeek."
Nigel, Just look at the amazing amount of care and attention he pays to his fans and his car.
Pit Man," Listen to those fans, Paolo. They love you."
Vanderbeek," Eh, who cares? (walks away)"
Adrian, What's this? Paolo is walking away from the pits.
Nigel, And the race.
Doofenshmirtz," Ha ha! What a shot! Norm, set me down next to the registration booth and you go get the car ready."
Norm," Roger wilco, sir!"
Adrian, Wait a second. There seems to be a last minute entry. A Heinz Doofen...Doofen.... Ih...hopeless with Drusselsteinian names.
Nigel," Hand it over, mate. Let's see. (takes the script from Adrian and reads it) ""Dorkenshmitz""?"
Ian," D-Doofen...Doofenshmuntz, Doofenshmuntz. Oh, that's utterly ridiculous."
Adrian," Whatever his name is, he's no Vanderbeek. That's for sure."
Nigel, There's the flag! And they're off!
Major Monogram," Psst, Agent P, over here! Doof has shot Vanderbeek with some kind of—oh, right, he probably monologued his scheme to you already. Anyhow, we need you to take Vanderbeek's place in the race, get that inator, and get back here to reverse its effect, so Vanderbeek can finish the race and defeat Doofenshmirtz. Carl has been trying to convince Vanderbeek to get back in the race using his sophisticated powers of persuasion."
Carl," C'mon, pretty please? Pretty please with a cherry on top? I'll be your best friend!"
Major Monogram," Yeah, you better get goin', Agent P. You can use the disguise setting on your Olson Martin. (Perry takes his Olson Martin out of his pocket, pushes a button, and it turns into Vanderbeek's mustache. He puts it on.) Wow, the resemblance is uncanny! Good luck, Agent P!"
Nigel, What's this? Hello! It looks like Paolo Vanderbeek is back in the race!
Candace," Wow, this isn't nearly as lame as I thought."
Lawrence, That's why our couch cushions are worn so unevenly. 'Cause we're always on the edge of our seats.
Doofenshmirtz," Let's see if I can rub this guy the wrong way. (He laughs as he rams a car.) Nice bumpin' into ya! Maybe it's time to use a little elbow grease. (He pushes a button and some grease spews out of the back of his car causing the car to slide right out of the race.) Alright, smoke 'em if you got 'em! (Black smoke spews out of the exhaust pipe.)"
Nigel," Approaching the Phillips' head turn, millimetrically perfect!"
Adrian, Or .04 inches perfect for backwards people who don't use the metric system.
Nigel, Dumpendork is gonna have his work cut out for him if he wants to stay in the lead.
Doofenshmirtz," Paolo Vanderbeek? He's back? Eh, looks like I'm gonna have to through the works at him. There ya go. (The exhaust pipe flips open throwing everything...and the kitchen sink which the car dodges.)"
Nigel," I say, that is an unprecedented amount of contact shunts and shenanigans!"
Adrian, Shenanigans?
Ian, You don't think there's some sort of foul play afoot.
Adrian, In Grand Prix racing? Don't be ridiculous!
Nigel, That kind of thing only happens in cartoons.
Doofenshmirtz, Looks like somebody needs another shot of the I-Don't-Care-inator. (The car runs over some parts and the inator slips out of Doof's hand.) What? Uh-oh! That's mine! (Perry catches the inator.)
Adrian, And that last contact has put Doofenshmuntz spinning across the course!
Nigel, And Vanderbeek is pulling into the pits! What is wrong?
Carl," Come on, whatta ya, chicken? Bagawk!"
Major Monogram," Good work, Agent P! Now we just need you to...Oh, okay, yeah, you got it covered, too."
Vanderbeek, Bocce balls! I cannot disappoint my fans!
Ian, Doifenshmuntz has got himself going again with the help of an extremely large metal pit crew member.
Nigel," This is, without a doubt, the weirdest race I've ever seen."
Vanderbeek," Grazie tonto, little beaver-duck guy! I'm-a about to win-a!"
Ian, And Paolo is back on the course!
Adrian, He'll have to really put his foot in if he wants to catch Doofenshmintz by the end of the race!
Doofenshmirtz," Not to make excuses, but sometimes, it's okay to be a little bit tacky. (He pushes a button and a bunch of tacks come out of the front, piercing his own tires.) Oh, maybe the tacks are supposed to be in the back."
Adrian, Dirkenshplurtz has run himself off the course completely!
Pool Guy," Gladys, j'ai une autre. (Subtitle: Gladys, we have another one.)"
Nigel, And Vanderbeek pushes past just in time to seize the checkered flag! Well done!
Candace," Oh, yeah! Go, Paolo! Go, Paolo!"
Linda, Woo-hoo!
Lawrence, What an exciting finish!
Candace," That was awesome! (looks behind her to see nothing there) Huh, I guess they're not doing anything today. (leaves) I am going to the mall and picking up a pleather jumpsuit!"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, did I win? (He takes off his helmet, which splashes more water onto him.) Oh, wait, no! Curse you, Paolo Vanderbeek! Y'know, that just doesn't roll off the tongue the way ""Perry the Platypus"" does. Perry the Platypus, Perry the Platypus."
Adrian," And, on that bombshell, we bid farewell from glamorous Montevillebad!"
