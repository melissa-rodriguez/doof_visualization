Announcer," From the PFT Studios in still moderately charming and majestic downtown Danville, it's—"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, yeah, we know the drill. We've hosted before. (pointing to Major Monogram) He's good, I'm evil, blah blah blah."
Major Monogram," I, for one, am excited to be here."
Doofenshmirtz, I'm all tingly! I've actually got butterflies in my sto—
Announcer," Let me finish my introduction! Welcome to Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by...Kelly Osbourne! (Timpani drum plays as Doof and Monogram get questionable looks on their faces.) And now, here's our host: She's a singer, an actor, a fashionista du jour, Kelly Osbourne!"
Kelly Osbourne," Hi, everybody! What'cha doin'? I have always wanted to say that. I am so excited to be here. I promise you guys, this is gonna be a rockin' show full of surprises. And anyone who knows anything about me, they know that I absolutely LOVE Phineas and Ferb! And being a singer myself, I love love LOVE the songs."
Doofenshmirtz," Wai-wai-wai-, w-what's goin' on here?! We are the hosts!"
Major Monogram," Yeah, and, uh, aren't you a little too three-dimensional to host an animated show, young lady?"
Kelly Osbourne," Yes. Yes, I am. But I'm doing it anyway, so just deal with it."
Doofenshmirtz, But w-we have hosting contracts and everything!
Kelly Osbourne, Did you read your contract?
Doofenshmirtz," Nobody reads them, they're like a hundred pages long and pages 2 through 99 are useless, like, like parsley on a dinner plate. Nobody eats it. Y'know, if they're gonna put stuff on your plate that y-you're not gonna eat, why not make it something useful, like a-like a keychain or, or gold doubloons."
Kelly Osbourne," Dude, why are you rambling on about parsley? You're bringing the entire energy of the show down! Maybe you guys can be my co-hosts!"
Doofenshmirtz, Co-hosts? I don't like the sound of that. Sounds like a demotion.
Kelly Osbourne," Enough of you two. (to the audience) You guys ready? Let's get this party started! (applause) There were so many songs to pick from, I mean, just take a look at all of them."
Major Monogram," Wow, that is a lot of songs."
Kelly Osbourne, You guys voted and now we're gonna rock the top 10! Here's number 10!
Guy, Is this the Phineas and Ferb party?
Guy #2, Sure is.
Guy, Phineas and Ferb parties rule! (all cheering)
Candace," It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. (Shattering) (Gasps) What was that? Put that down, pardon me, use a napkin! What's my science teacher doing here?"
Teacher, I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party!

Kelly Osbourne, I've been a co-host before and I had a blast doing it!
Doofenshmirtz," Well, goody gumdrops for you!"
Major Monogram," Don't worry, Kelly. I am totally down for being second banana."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, first of all, that's a little sad. But, second of all, technically, you would be third banana. It would go: Kelly, and then me, and then you. And, ih, I would be second banana."
Kelly Osbourne," Nobody is a banana, because there are no bananas!"

Major Monogram," Uh, really?"
Kelly Osbourne," You look a bit, like, stiff and-and uniformy. Right, guys?"
Major Monogram, Uniformy? Is that even a word?
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, ""uniformy."" If you look it up, there's a picture of you."
Kelly Osbourne, You're one to talk.
Doofenshmirtz, What?
Kelly Osbourne," I mean that whole laboratory look was was never in, I mean, even if you are an ""evil scientist"". You should try a cape."
Doofenshmirtz, A cape? Where am I gonna get a cape at this hour?
Major Monogram, You could try a Nehru jacket.

Doofenshmirtz, It wasn't a secret.
Kelly Osbounre, You know what we should do then? Strike a pose.
Doofenshmirtz," Vogue. Vogueing. That's it. Look it up, kids. That's what the internet is for."
Major Monogram," That was fun! Great idea, Kelly."
Kelly Osbourne, Thank you.
Doofenshmirtz," But, but, vogueing was my idea! I started to say ""vogueing"" and you just cut me off right before when I just got ""vo"" out. Y'know, I— (to Monogram) What did you think I was gonna say? Vociferous? What other words start with ""vo""?"

(Perry holds onto a rope with one hand and holds a mirror in the other.)"
Kelly Osbourne, Wow. That was close.
Doofenshmirtz, Wait. Was that Perry the Platypus? Great. They're probably letting him host the show.
Kelly Osbourne," Everyone welcome Perry! (massive applause) Oh my gosh, this day just keeps getting better and better! You know, I was hoping you'd stop by. Do you...Do you want to introduce the next song?"
