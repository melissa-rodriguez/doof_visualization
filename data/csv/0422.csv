Spider-Man," Aunt May, Phineas and Ferb are making a crossover!"
Phineas, Yeah we are!
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, That was awesome!
Phineas, Yeah! The cosmic rays we collected through our satellite dish made a great power source for our surfboards.
Baljeet," Well, I, for one, need to get back to the space station."
Phineas, All right.
Buford," You know, these suits are equipped with..."
Baljeet, I do not want to do it in the suit!
Irving," Hi, guys! How are the asteroid waves?"
Phineas," They were totally cranking, dude!"
Irving," (laughing) He called me ""dude""!"
Phineas, We're about to take the module down. Are we clear for landing?
Irving, One moment. (He gets up)
Irving," All clear! But hey, where's Perry?"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Struggle all you want, Perry the Platypus, you're not getting out of that! It's hydraulic! I don't know if you're aware of this, but my brother, Roger, is the mayor. (Perry just gives him a look indicating that he was, in fact, aware of it.) Alright, I may have touched upon the subject from time to time, but, y'know, I figured why not mention it again just for clarity? Anyway, that job gives him all these cool mayoral powers. So I created the Power-Drain-inator to drain all his powers into this canister, and then I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, get to wield them! Just think, I will have the power to raise taxes, pass legislation and even cut the ceremonial ribbon at openings! Where I'll finally be able to use (He produces a pair of giant scissors from behind his back) these! You like them? I-I got 'em at a garage sale. (He leans the scissors onto a hydraulic pump, which leaks and releasing Perry from his trap.) Ah, see? Th-th-that's one of those hydraulic lines that, uh, goes to your— (Perry flings himself at Doofenshmirtz, who falls backwards, and then takes the inator, smashing it to pieces.) Aw, come on!!! One kick and you destroy my inator? Right? Wait And what? You're just gonna thwart and run? I thought this was going to be a special extended episode! Curse you Perry the Platypus even though you weren't involved in this scheme what so over!!!!...and he's gone, again! (A piece of the broken inator zaps up to the sky.) Aaah! Uh-oh."
Hot Dog Vendor," Hey, Vinnie, the usual?"
Vinnie," Yeah, same old, same old."
New Yorker," Go get 'em, Spider-Man!"
Spider-Man, Woo!! (He gets splashed by a fire hydrant) I didn't know this was gonna be a pool party. I woulda brought my trunks!
Iron Man," Oh, hey, kid! Glad you could make it!"
Spider-Man, (while webbing Venom) I'm just fashionably late.
Iron Man," Back off, fellas! If that thing firing anti-matter blasts, it's gonna pack a big punch!"
Hulk, I pack a bigger punch!
Hulk, (Grunts)
Red Skull," MODOK, take them all out! [""them"" is ""zem""]"
MODOK, Fool! Your webs cannot stop my mind! (He laughs)
Spider-Man, Missed me!
Iron Man, That's it for you creeps!
Spider-Man, Ooh ooh! Can I web 'em up?
Marvel Heroes, (Groans)
Red Skull," Let's go! (The villains all flee but Red Skull bumps into MODOK.) Move, you beat them schnitzel!!!"
Thor, What was that?
Spider-Man," I dunno. But they're getting away! (He attempts to climb a wall, but falls.) Whoa! Ooff! Well, that's new."
Iron Man, Something's wrong. I can't move!
Thor," Sit tight! Mighty Mjolnir will bring them down! (He attempts to throw the hammer, but it crashes into the ground.) My strength, it's gone!"
Hulk," I'll go. (Hulk tries to smash, but nothing happens.)"
Iron Man," Somehow our powers have been drained. I need to get to JARVIS and figure this out. Let's get back to S.H.I.E.L.D. (The heroes all walk away, except for Iron Man who attempts to move, but remains immobile.) Hey, guys! My power's down and my suit's frozen! Could somebody get me a hand?"
Spider-Man," Hulk, can you carry him?"
Hulk," My power's gone, too."
Iron Man," Oh, for...Well, can somebody find a furniture dolly?"
Buford, That was the best thing we've done this morning!
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Mom! Hurry! Here! Look!
Phineas," Hi, Mom!"
Linda Flynn-Fletcher," Hi, kids!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Why aren't you in space?
Buford," Eh, we got hungry."
Linda Flynn-Fletcher," Oh, that's my cue! I'll make you guys some snacks before I leave!"
Spider-Man," Well, this stinks! Without my spider-powers, I'm just a guy in a body stocking!"
Thor, And I had to leave Mjolnir in the street!
Thor, It just became too heavy.
Iron Man," At least you guys aren't locked inside this metal suit. Man, do I regret having that second cup of coffee this morning. Now we have to find out where that beam came from."
Nick Fury," Danville. Danville, USA."
Spider-Man, Have you been standing there this whole time?
Nick Fury," Yes. Yes I have. (He walks to a screen which shows the inator beam hitting the space station satellite) The beam that hit you originated from the Tri-State Area, bounced off a space station satellite dish, and hit you in New York City during your fight."
Spider-Man, Is that one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s?
Nick Fury, No. It's theirs.
Spider-Man," Man, that kid's got a weird-shaped head."
Iron Man," (jumping) Hey! Hey! Guys, I can't see with the... (falls down) Little help here?"
Hulk, I got him.
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Make sure you get all these little pieces over here, too. No no no, you're missing the big one."
Norm, Okey-dokey!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Y'know, Norm, the Power-Drain-inator did get one shot off before it died. I wonder if it hit anything."
Gordon Gutsofanemu," (on television) Dateline: New York City. A mysterious ray has drained the power from four of our beloved superheroes. We now return you to Horse in a Bookcase, already in progress."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," That was me! Th-Th-That was me! I drained the power from those superheroes! Winning! Ooh, ooh, I should update my evil blog on the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. site! (sits down at the computer and types) OMG!! I drained all the powers from a group of superheroes in New York, and those powers belong to me now! Happy Emoticon (Typed out as >:D >:D >:D) And send! Norm, let's get the powers out of the canister so I can start wielding them! I-I can't wait to fly and run fast and carry a big hammer around for no reason!"
Norm," Uh, sir, I hate to be the bearer of empty canisters, but this canister is empty."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, What?! So I don't have the powers?
Norm," Time to blog a retraction, I guess."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Uh, y'know, I'm not gonna change it. Everyone exaggerates on the Internet."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz,"Words is ""the"" replace with ""ze"", ""when"" is ""ven"", ""weren't"" is ""vwren't""."
Red Skull," There was a slight miscalculation. It becomes clearer upon seeing this footage. [""this"" is ""zis""]"
Whiplash," That is more than a slight miscalculation, Red Skull. It's a major mistake!"
Venom, We could have destroyed the heroes once and for all!
Red Skull, Enough! It doesn't change the fact that the heroes are now powerless!
Whiplash," Well, what could have happened to their powers?"
Red Skull, MODOK?
MODOK," I, MODOK, the perfect combination of human intellect and machine, have interfaced with all of the digital information stored on the vast network, the World Wide Web!"
Whiplash, I can do the same thing with my phone. Plus I got free roaming!
Venom, Nice!
MODOK," As I was saying, I have found some puny inferior human known as Heinz Doofenshmirtz claiming that he has drained the heroes of all their superpowers."
Red Skull," Hmm, Heinz Doofenshmirtz. That sounds Drusselstein I have a cousin who married a Drusselstein. She is dead to me!! So, who is this Heinz Doofenshmirtz?"
MODOK, I'm projecting his image now.
Red Skull, He is beautifully grotesque.
Whiplash, All hideous and deformed.
Venom, He must have some backstory.
Red Skull, Where can we find this sideshow freak?
MODOK," (showing an image of D.E.I.) He's in the Tri-State Area, Danville to be precise!"
Red Skull," Danville, eh? Gentlemen, it looks like we're going on an evil road trip."
MODOK," Ooh, shotgun!"
Red Skull, YOU DO NOT FIT IN THE SHOTGUN POSITION!!!!
Phineas," Well, that was fun, and it's only 10:30. What else should we do today?"
Linda," Oh, hey, kids. I'm gonna be taking a walking tour of the Tri-State Area today. (her phone rings) Yes, Candace, you're in charge."
Candace, Whoopee!!
Linda," Bye, kids."
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry? Oh, there he is!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus...You're not Perry the Platypus! Who are you guys?"
Red Skull," This is Whiplash, this is Venom, and I am Red Skull."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Yes. Yes, you are. Y'know, you really should use sunblock. You're burned down to the bone."
MODOK," I am MODOK, and you are the one they call ""Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz""."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Oh, yeah. That's what they sing at the end of the birthday song...Ah, well, y'know, at least they...would have if...anybody ever sang....that song to me. Anyway...Hey, the floating head and little arms thing. I tried that back in the '90s."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, I'll rule the Tri-State Area~! (bumps into a wall)
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," I could never maneuver out the front door, but I see you're pretty mobile. What are you guys doing here?"
Red Skull," Show us your devices, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," ""Shess-so-davices?"" Is that Latin?"
Red Skull, Show us your devices.
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, I'm still not getting it. Anyone?
Whiplash, I have no idea.
Red Skull, (grunts) Show us your devices!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Oh, you want to see my inators! Man...Man, you've got quite an accent there! Alright, (walks up to an inator) here's what I'm working on now. Behold, the Slothinator! It will give me the powers of a sloth...which are super-slowness and super-leaf-eating."
Red Skull, (to MODOK) Are you sure this is the right guy?
MODOK, MODOK is infallible!
Red Skull, Then he must be toying with us. Playing us for fools! He is even more diabolical than we thought!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," (holding up a branch) Seriously, I'll be able to eat this whole branch, but...y'know, like, slowly."
Phineas," Ferb, are you expecting someone?"
Ferb, Not them.
Ferb,Act II
Spider-Man, (offscreen) Aren't you a little young to be stealing superheroes superpowers?
Phineas," Yes. Yes, we would be, Spider-Man, if we actually did it. But like I said, I don't think we did."
Iron Man," You can't see it, but I have a rather severe look of disappointment on my face."
Isabella, This'll turn that tin frown upside down!
Thor, Juice in a box? We have nothing like this in Asgard.
Hulk, (grunting) Straw cannot penetrate!
Spider-Man," Hey, hey, hey! Calm blue ocean. (taking the juice box) Let me take care of that for ya, buddy."
Iron Man," Thanks, Isabella. Well, the power-siphoning ray originated from the Tri-State Area. And I was thinking you guys would know something about it since it bounced off your space station."
Phineas, Are you sure it was our space station?
Hulk, It was shaped like your head.
Phineas," Well, that sounds like ours, but we don't know anything about a power-siphoning ray."
Iron Man," I was afraid of that. Well, the first thing we gotta do is get our powers back."
Phineas," Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today..."
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," (coming down the stairs) Alright, boys and girls, listen up, Mom's on a walking tour of Danville and Dad's tinkering in the basement, so I'm in charge. That means no shenanigans! Hey, Spider-Man. So I'll be over at Stacy's all day?!"
Spider-Man, What's up?
Thor," Greetings, fair young maiden..."
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, It's super hero in our kitchen!
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Candace is gonna lie down for a while.
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, 
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Heroes...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Thor...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Hulk...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Iron Man...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,In...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Our...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,Kitchen...
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro,
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro,That's it.
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro,Just breathe.
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro,They're only superheroes.
Phineas, Looks like you guys have a fan.
Iron Man," Oh, boy. (Tips over and an inexplicable cat is heard screeching.)"
Thor, And it's probably good she didn't see that.
Iron Man, I'm okay.
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Have a seat, Agent P. (cut to reveal Monogram on an old black and white TV set) Due to the gravity of your mission today, the gentleman on the big screen will be addressing you (Wide shot to reveal Fury on the big screen) while I use this old TV monitor Carl found in the basement."
Carl the Intern," (offscreen) Sorry, sir, I couldn't get the split-screen to work."
Major Monogram," Anyway, this is director Nick Fury of S-H-I-E-L-D."
Nick Fury, That's S.H.I.E.L.D.! It's an acronym.
Major Monogram," Oh, like ""OWCA""."
Nick Fury," Yes, except it's cool. Now, where is your agent, Major?"
Major Monogram, He's sitting right there.
Nick Fury, You mean behind the platypus?
Major Monogram," No, that's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus."
Nick Fury, Is he some kind of super-platypus with super-platypus powers?
Major Monogram, (suddenly wearing an eyepatch) Uh...no.
Nick Fury, Does he have some kind of robotic platypus exoskeleton?
Major Monogram," He, uh, he has a fedora."
Nick Fury," Hey, wait a minute, were you wearing that eyepatch when we started?!"
Major Monogram," Oh, this? Uh, yeah. It's, uh, doctor's orders. I have a stye."
Carl, (offscreen) He thinks it makes him look cool.
Major Monogram, No I don't.
Nick Fury," I'm going to proceed as if this were going really well. Agent P, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Spider-Man have lost their superpowers to a mysterious power-siphoning ray, which we believe originated somewhere in the Danville area. We fear a group of supervillains are closing in. We need you to monitor the situation and report back. (Monogram is now wearing eyepatches on both eyes.) Francis, I'm gonna need you to—Now what are you doing?"
Carl the Intern, (offscreen) He thinks two eyepatches make him look twice as cool.
Major Monogram, I don't know what you're talking about.
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Welcome to my Hall of Inators. Ah, here's a good one. This is my Oatmeal-to-Porridge-inator. I know. It's a fine distinction. Don't get me started. And here's my Multi-Helio-Tactical-Baboon-Glom-inator. I think that one is self-explanatory. Oh, and, uh, here's my Waffle-inator, and the Junk-Mail-inator..."
Red Skull, I do not understand. Sees machines are useless. What is wrong is this man?
Whiplash, Maybe he is a misunderstood genius.
Red Skull, Or maybe he is a perfectly understood idiot.
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," And, finally, my Disintegrator-inator. Pretty impressive, huh?"
Red Skull, Were is the machine that took away the powers of the heroes?
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Oh, my Power-Drain-inator! Ooh, that was a cool one! And it was...destroyed by my nemesis, Perry the Platypus, Pinky the Chihuahua & Peter the Panda. You just missed 3 of him."
Red Skull," Perry the Platypus, Pinky the Chihuahua & Peter the Panda? Is he a super-soldieragents?"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, No.
Venom, Was he bitten by a radioactive agents?
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," No, his's, uh, just a regular crime-fighting agents."
Red Skull, It is no matter! You will rebuild the machine!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Oh, so we're working together now! Great! I'll be the leader! I've always wanted an evil entourage."
Whiplash, Let's destroy them.
Red Skull," Nope. Let him think he is in charge. When he has exceeded his usefulness, we will give him to MODOK to destroy."
Whiplash," Hey, where is MODOK?"
MODOK," Curse you, Danville, town of small doors!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Listen, before I rebuild the machine, I've got some errands to run. You guys should come with. (Red Skull hisses) Is your head gonna burst into flames or am I thinking of somebody else?"
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen...and Hulk, allow me to unveil our Secret Hideout for Emergency Defects. Or S.H.E.D. for short."
Iron Man, I think we're gonna need something a little...bigger.
Phineas," Oh, the rustic exterior's a facade. Wait'll you see the inside!"
Iron Man," Oh, man! You guys are good!"
Ferb, Just a little British sci-fi technology.
Thor," Iron Man, looks like someone raided your armory."
Phineas," Oh, you like that, huh? This is The Beak Suit Mark 2. We're still working on the waterproofing so we can't take it out in the rain."
Iron Man," You know, Stark Industries offers summer internships."
Phineas," Thanks, but this summer's pretty packed."
Iron Man, Apparently.
Phineas, (handing some cards to the gang and the superheroes) And these are your S.H.E.D. key card IDs. They'll get you into all areas of the compound.
Spider-Man, Ooh! And they're laminated!
Spider-Man," I'm sorry, but we're not allowed to accept unsolicited material."
Isabella," Candace, I didn't know you were a fangirl."
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," ​​​​​​ Oh, sure. From way back. It started 'cause I had to do a lot of research to get up to speed for the Ducky Momo superhero crossover event."
Japanese Announcer, Quack quack Ducky Momoーさんスーパーヒーローです！
Phineas," Okay, superheroes. We have to get to work building a device that will restore your powers."
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! (laughing neverously)"
Phineas," Until we find out what happened to your actual powers, this machine should be able to replicate them temporarily. Everyone in position and we'll start calibrating!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Let's get our hero on!
Phineas," Just a minute, Candace. We all set?"
Ferb, All set. Just as soon as I...
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Great! All set!
Ferb, ...lock down the power assignments and reverse polarity.
Phineas," Candace, what did you do?!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Uh-oh.
Phineas, Are you guys okay?
Thor," By Odin's beard, I feel invigorated! (Jumps up high)"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, See? It worked! Hmm?
Phineas," Well, not exactly. Look."
Thor, Something is not right.
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Woo! Oh, boy, that was great! Hey, I've got an idea, let's go get some ice cream and spoil our dinner! I mean, who's gonna tell us no?"
Whiplash, That's it! I've had it! We're wasting our time! (takes out his whips and whips a Ducky Momo kiosk) We need to bring the heroes to us!
Kiosk Girl, Well...
Phineas," Something's gone terribly wrong, Candace! You've swapped all their powers. (Cut to Thor wall crawling.) Obviously, Thor's got Spider-Man's powers. (Cut to Spidey lifting up something heavy.) Spider-Man got Hulk's powers."
Spider-Man," Yeah, I could get used to this!"
Baljeet, I-I have a fear of heights. Could you please put us down?
Phineas, Iron Man must have Thor's powers.
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Well, at least he can move now."
Phineas," Everyone has new superpowers except Hulk. He must have Iron Man's powers. But without the suit, there's not much there."
Hulk, I am feeling entrepreneurial.
Phineas, At least his vocabulary's improved.
Iron Man," So give me the hammer. What do I do? I just stick out my hand, right? Come on, baby, come to papa!"
Thor, That is not how it works.
Iron Man, Whadaya mean? I got your powers.
Thor," Wielding Mjolnir is about worthiness, not power."
Iron Man, Really?
Thor," It's a fine distinction, but an important one."
Iron Man," Potato, potahto."
Thor, I do not know what that means.
Iron Man," Okay, nevermind. What about the lightning? How do I control that?"
Thor," Actually, that only works with the hammer."
Iron Man, What about flying? I've seen you fly.
Thor," Well, yes. But not without the..."
Iron Man, Not without the hammer. Right.
Phineas," This is a disaster, Candace!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Look, it was an accident! But I can still help! I know that the villains will..."
Phineas," No!!! You don't know!! The entire Tri-State Area, and, possibly, the world is at stake here! Honestly, Candace, if you don't know what you're doing, keep your hands off the machinery!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Well, then, maybe I should just leave!"
Phineas, Yeah! Maybe you should!
Gordon Gutsofanemu," Alert! Alert! Relevant news broadcast intercepted! (The gang and the heroes walk up to the TVs.) This just in: Disaster in Danville! Horse in a Bookcase is cancelled after a nineteeen-year run.  Also, (Image of the Googolplex Mall appears on screen.) chaos at the Googolplex Mall! (Image of Venom, Whiplash and Red Skull in the mall appears on screen.) An evil entourage of three supervillains (file photo of Doof appears on screen) and what appears to be a pharmacist (image of MODOK appears on screen) and a giant chicken egg with a face are bustin' up the place somethin' fierce!"
Thor, We are needed!
Phineas, But you can't! Your powers! They're not fixed yet! We just need more time.
Iron Man," I know, Phineas, but we're heroes. This is what we do."
Phineas," Wait, can we help?"
Iron Man, Not unless you can fly.
Phineas," Well, it's not raining! (Fist bumps Ferb.)"
The Beak, Bacaw! Woohoo!!
Red Skull, This should get their attention. (Evil laughter)
Spider-Man, Looks like somebody left the door open!
Iron Man," Alright, gang, it's showtime! Everybody ready?"
Spider-Man, I feel pretty good.
Hulk, I'd feel better with a metal suit.
The Beak," Sorry, big guy, no time!"
Iron Man, (pointing up) Look!
Red Skull," Ah, the superheroes are here to save the day. But without your powers, this is just a costume party. MODOK, destroy them!"
MODOK," Yes, I will take great pleasure in destroying these puny heroes!"
Spider-Man," I got 'im, guys! Spider-Man smash! (Spidey smashes through the roof of the Googolplex Mall while Linda is outside listening on her headphones oblivious)"
Tour Guide, Looking to your left you'll see...
Spider-Man, (screamming loud)
Hulk, Was he making fun of me?
Thor," A little, yes."
Whiplash, They still have their powers!
Red Skull," Yes, but they are all mixed up! (He lifts Doofenshmirtz up by his lab coat) This is your doing!??!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Uh, I don't remember making a Power-Switch-inator, but, ih, y'know, I make a lot of inators!"
Iron Man," Y'know, it'd be really nice right now to have the power to throw a hammer!"
Thor," I told you it's not about power, it's about worthiness! (sigh) It's like talking to a Bilgesnipe."
The Beak, Bacaw!
MODOK," Hey, what's going on?!"
Thor," I find myself in a sticky situation. Oh no, I've received Spider-Man's propensity for puns!"
Phineas, Now I wish we'd prioritized the waterproofing.
Hulk, Now I'm Iron Man! (The real Iron Man crashes into the impostor. Spidey finally comes down to Earth crashing on an eyeglass kiosk.)
Spider-Man," Okay, that time, I overshot the mark. Oh, hey, Venom. What'd I miss? (Venom grabs Spidey, choking him.)"
Phineas," Spider-Man, are you okay?"
Spider-Man," Could be worse! At least Iron Man and Thor are... (Cut to MODOK harming Thor.) Well, at least Iron Man..."
Iron Man," (tied up in Whiplash's whips) Sorry, gang. A little tied up at the moment."
Spider-Man," Okay, nevermind. It couldn't be worse...!"
Spider-Man,Act III
Stan Lee," (voiceover) Welcome back, faithful viewers! When last we left our handsome heroes, their fate hung in the balance in a cataclysmic cliffhanger."
Red Skull, This was all too easy. The time for heroes is over. Now all will bow to us. And nothing will save you now.
Red Skull, (coughing) Stop them!
Spider-Man," Hey, Duck Guy, thanks for the rescue! (to Iron Man) Do we tip him?"
Iron Man, He's not parking our car.
Spider-Man, I just don't know the etiquette.
Red Skull, Dah! Who was that masked...beaver...duck?
MODOK, MODOK will exterminate all beaver-ducks!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Y'know, none of this would have happened if we had just gone out for ice cream like I suggested!"
Thor," (to Agent P) Thank you, small but mighty friend!"
Phineas," You know, he seemed vaguely familiar."
Spider-Man, Ya think that was Howard the Duck?
Iron Man," Time is of the essence. We've gotta—No, it wasn't Howard the Duck!"
Spider-Man, What? I'm just sayin'.
Hulk, He did have a bill.
Iron Man," Anyway, we need to regroup and figure out a plan B."
Phineas, Right! Back to S.H.E.D.-quarters!
Phineas," Hi, guys!"
Buford," So, how'd it go?"
Iron Man, We got our butts handed to us. (to Spidey) How was Venom able to overpower you when you had Hulk's strength?
Spider-Man, I don't know. I'm...I'm not feeling it anymore.
Thor," Wait, let me try something. (runs to the wall and jumps up, but falls down.) I did not stick."
Phineas, I was afraid of that. The powers are not bonding with your cel structures.
Iron Man," Yes, my suit is getting heavier again. But at least having Thor's strength unlocked the joints so I could move."
Baljeet," Perhaps we can give you a recharge, but, of course, this time with the correct powers. We have been working on rebuilding the machine."
Phineas, (taking off the Beak's torso) You are?
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, I'm redeeming myself.
Baljeet," Yes, and we are almost done with the first component."
Buford," Hulk's gamma-ray concentration beam. Brawn first, right, big guy?"
Phineas, That's great!
Iron Man, So have you done a base level particle acceleration yet?
Baljeet, I was just about to.
Iron Man, It's really important to make sure you start with a base level.
Phineas," Oh, sure. Otherwise the gamma-rays would..."
Phineas, Whoa! Who plugged...
Baljeet, Uh...oh...
Hulkjeet, Baljeet smash!! (Smashes the machine to pieces and runs out crashing through the wall running by the Garcia-Shapiro house and jumping off.)
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Wow. There's something you don't see every day... (sees Phineas' über-ticked-off expression) What? What?
Phineas," Really, Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn? Do you have any idea what you just did?!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, I was just trying to help.
Phineas," Well, your ""help"" this morning messed up so badly, we came this close to being wiped out at the mall! I thought you would've learned your lesson!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, But...I...
Phineas," ""But"" nope! You show up again to help, and now Baljeet has been hulkified and is rampaging who knows where!! And we're back to square one with restoring the heroes's powers!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, But...
Phineas," This is just too important! And we can't afford any more setbacks! (Takes off her lanyard) I'm reworking your S.H.E.D. card... (Tears up the card.) You have to go, NOW!"
Buford, I've always told her: Don't ever make Phineas angry. You wouldn't like it when he's angry.
Isabella, Oh no! Baljeet! We've gotta go after him!
Thor," Sadly, there is no time! Our mission lies elsewhere!"
Isabella," Well, I'll go after him then!"
Buford," Nah, nah. I'll go! You stay here, little girl, it might get ugly."
Isabella, What? You don't think I can handle ugly? I've been hangin' out with you all summer!
Buford, Sticks and stones!
Nick Fury," Greetings, Agent P! S.H.I.E.L.D. has gotten intel that the supervillains are holed up in downtown Danville in an oddly-shaped building with its own jingle. We need you to find out what they're up to!"
Major Monogram," (now sporting an eyepatch and a goatee like Fury) And neutralize them if possible, Agent P!"
Nick Fury," Monogram! Seriously, the beard, too?!"
Major Monogram," You're not the only one who can rock an awesome face mullet, Fury!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," (standing in front of an inator) And see, it takes four orbs of mundanium finite to power it. It would only take one orb of Pizzazium Infinionite but that's so hard to find. Oh, don't get me started! So we just lock the module in here and...Volia! Yeah, I know, it's a large violin. I don't know why people say that. Anyhoo, what did you guys need a second Power-Drain-inator for?"
Red Skull, So we won't have to deal with your idiocy anymore! (Takes out a remote and traps Doof in a cage.)
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Wait, that's not nice! I thought we were buds! We were amigos! We had a song and everything!"
Red Skull," Your little musical interlude vas a pleasant diwersion at best! You see, we're not going to take over the Tri-State Area. We are going to completely destroy it and show what whill happen if anyone attempts to thwart our plan!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Did you just say, ""Swart our plan""?"
Red Skull, No. Swart! Sw- with a T-H! Thwart !'
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Oh, ""thwart""! Yeah, it makes more sense. I think that maybe you should go see a speech pathologist or a-a-a dialect coach or something..."
Red Skull," SILENCE!!! Once we've made our point, we will use our contraption to draw away the powers of all the superheroes on the planet! And take over the world!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Wow, you guys really think big!"
Red Skull," But first, Venom, squash our little fly on the ceiling!"
Red Skull, Now we go and send a little message to our handicapped heroes. Come! Schnitzel!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, (to Perry) You're not very good at thwarting. I...I should hook you up with my nemesis Perry the Platypus for some pointers. It's an art form for him.
Hulkjeet, BALJEET SMASH!!!
Tour Guide, The courtyard also features a statue of Franz the Elephant.
Isabella," (sadly) Hey, Candace. What'cha doin'?"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Just laying here. Utterly dejected.
Isabella," I hear you. None of the women superheroes showed up, so it's all about testosterone and...powers and...fighting, which... (shrugs) yeah."
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, I was only trying to help but all I did was mess things up. (sigh) I'm useless.
Isabella, I know exactly how you feel.
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro," ♪ Well, it's all about the boys playing with their macho toys"
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro,"And they're making so much noisy, I didn't really want to shout."

Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn,"And now I've been sent into seclusion, I've been banished and cast out!"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn and Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (in harmony)," I'm not trying to place the blame, but I feel it just the same"

Isabella," ...trying to help, Phineas."
Lawrence," Hello, girls. (Wide shot to reveal the ""rain"" is actually the sprinkler.) Don't mind me. I'm just givin' the lawn a bit of a drink. (turns it off) It's off now."
Buford," Hey, Baljeet! (Hulkjeet roars and picks Buford up by the shirt.) Heh heh heh...heh...I'm so happy that I found you! I worry about you, you know. Because...you're my best friend."
Baljeet," Ah. Thanks, Buford. I did not like being an angry monster."
Buford, I'm glad. Because you weren't very good at it anyway!!
Baljeet, Really? I think I was actually quite terrifying.
Buford," Oh, come on! You're totally green! (No pun intended.) For example, when you grab somebody's shirt (grabs Baljeet's shirt) and lift 'em up..."
Baljeet, Hey!
Buford, ...ya gotta twist it first! (demonstrates) And you yelling REALLY LOUD!!!
Hulkjeet, (roars and lifts Buford back up) DO NOT YELLING AT BALJEET LIKE THAT!!! (throws Buford and roars and runs)
Buford," Okay, the throwing was good! But when you grabbed my shirt, you didn't twist!! I swear, it's like in one ear and right out de other! Oh, oh! Baljeet, wait up! (goes after him)"
Red Skull," Citizens of Danville and the surrounding Tri-State Area, prepare for your imminent end! Unless Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor and Hulk show up to face us, we will unleash a device a thousand times worse than the won that hit them! (pointing to the device behind him) Thanks to MODOK's modifications, our Power-Drain-inator doesn't merely drain power. It drains energy, matter, everything the target was! (presses a button) Observe."
Hot Dog Vendor," Aw, man! And I just moved here from New York, cuz I thought it would be safer!"
Phineas," Uh, guys, you better come see this."
Red Skull," So, heroes, either you come down here and face us, or we will unleash this weapon on the entire Tri-State Area! (Laughs evilly)"
Thor, Ah! The fiend!
Spider-Man," I actually missed a lot of that with the accent, but I got that it's bad."
Phineas," Oh, man. What're we gonna do?"
Thor, What we have to.
Phineas, But you have no powers.
Iron Man, That doesn't matter. We've gotta fight back with whatever we've got left.
Thor, Being a hero isn't the armor you wear. But the metal in your spirit and the steel in your resolve.
Spider-Man," Man, that was eloquent. All I ever do is quips. Like this one, for instance. And the one preceding it."
Iron Man, Can we please not kill the gravitas of this moment?
Spider-Man, Sorry.
Spider-Man,Act IV
Phineas, Man! We've got a lot to do if we're gonna get this suit back online. I think we can get 60% function back if we reroute the power flow through the backup circuits.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Maybe if I just go in and apologize one more time they'll forgive me. I have a stomachache, I feel so bad."
Isabella, They're your brothers. They'll listen.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," ​​​​​​ Phineas, look, I'm sorry."
Phineas, How did you get in? I thought I revoked your S.H.E.D. ID.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Isabella gave me her guest pass.
Phineas," Fine, but...don't touch anything."
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Ferb, you've gotta listen to me!"
Phineas," (to Ferb) The shoulder joint's ready. (climbing down the ladder) Excuse me, Candace."
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Phineas, can't you stop and listen?"
Phineas," Candace, you don't understand! The guys are in trouble! If we can't get downtown to help them, this may be their final battle!"
Whiplash, The heroes are not coming!
Red Skull," Oh, don't worry. They'll come."
MODOK, My sensors tell me the heroes are approaching.
Red Skull, Perfect! They're on the bus!
Little Old Lady," Outta my way, you weirdos! It's worse than Portland!"
Spider-Man," A mindball? Really? Hey, MODOK, can you feel it in your brain when I go like this? (rubs his hands against the ball)"
Red Skull, We have them now!
Whiplash, What about old lady?
Red Skull," Eh? Oh, she is not—She is not with them!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," (to Perry) So you're a superhero, huh? Don't you have some sort of power to get us out of this? (Perry pushes a button on his utility belt) Hey...Oh, wow! You've got...super wire cutters, huh? Oh, what are they, nail clippers that got bitten by radioactive pinching shears?"
Phineas, (sitting in the Beak suit) We've only got half the server motors on the right side online.

Whiplash, What?
Red Skull, I was talking to him!
Whiplash, Sorry.
Red Skull," Look around you! Now that you have no powers, you have no friends, no allies, you have nothing!"
Iron Man, We have a Baljeet.
Hulkjeet, Hulkjeet.
Iron Man," Oh, my bad. Apparently he prefers to be known as ""Hulkjeet"". (The Beak arrives.) And this thing."
The Beak, Bacaw!
Iron Man," If it's a bird, it's with us, too. (Agent P flies in) The flying duck with a beaver tail. We got him! (Waffles fall from the sky) But I gotta level with ya, I have no idea who's shooting waffles."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Woo-hoo! Top of the world, Ma!"
Spider-Man," Yo, Red, (holding the orbs) is this doohickey important?"

Hulkjeet, Hulkjeet!
The Beak, Bacaw!
Spider-Man, Woo!
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," (pacing back and forth) There's one thing I don't understand about the lost superpowers. In all the comics I've read, energy can never be destroyed. Only morphed into a different form or contained somehow."
Isabella," Candace, when we were up at the space station, we were collecting and containing data!"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, You were up in what?
Isabella," Oh, come on!"
Isabella, Have a seat.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, What are you talking about?
Isabella, Just go with it.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," ​​​Oh, that's where this thing was!"
Spider-Man, Fast cart!
Iron Man," Yeah, I souped it up!"
Spider-Man," (gives Iron Man the reactor core) Here! Hold this! (goes to the back and gets the caddy bag) You mind if I play through? (Unzips the front pocket emptying it of all the tees. Whiplash slips on the tees. Spidey gets out a club with dog-shaped cover on it and throws the caddy bag at Venom.) Go get 'im, boy! (Throws the club at MODOK.) Good dog!"
Bear Boy, Beware Bear Boy! (slaps the fish at Red Skull)
Hulk, Now you kids stay back! Hmm?
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, You don't think it's weird the space station looks like Phineas?
Isabella," If by ""weird"" you mean ""dreamy""."
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Oh, brother."
Isabella, Look! The collection tank! There's something glowing in there! It's gotta be the powers!
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, (looking through a telescope) Looks like the fight's begun! Now make the powers blast out...down there and stuff.
Isabella, I don't know how to do that!
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, ​​​​​​Whadaya mean? Didn't Phineas explain how to...
Isabella," Yeah. It was like, ""Isabella...blah blah blah blah blah...Isabella...blah blah blah blah blah..."" He was dressed like an astronaut! I was distracted!"
Red Skull, The Mundanium Finite! (to Venom) Get those orbs!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, these waffles aren't enough. I...I wish I could just disintegrate them all. (gasp) Oh, right! The Disintegrator-inator! Duh! (switches it on, nothing happens) I don't know what I was—Hey! (flips the switch up and down) Hey, what's wrong? Hmmm. (picks up the unplugged plug) Oh, here's the problem. (He walks up to an extension cord outlet, but the plug is too short.) Okay, I just need an extension cord this long. (Runs off.)"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Isabella, (points to a big red button) I think this is the button that'll release the superpowers!"
Isabella, How can you tell?
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Well, it's red, see? And there's some red detailing on that collector thing, so it's gotta be it."
Isabella, That's a very irrational and reckless deduction.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," ​​​​​No, Isabella! I've failed twice already so the third time's a charm!"

The Beak, That's not good.
Hulk, Hey! Over here!
Red Skull," Enough of this foolishness! (Places the reactor core back into the inator) Our triumph is at hand! (The inator activates.) And now, behold, the destruction of the entire Tri-State Area..."
Phineas," Hey, Ferb, is that our space station?"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," Yo, heroes, got a little something for ya! (rolls down the tank)"
Phineas, Candace! The data collection tank! Of course!

Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," I learned from the best, Spidey!"
Red Skull," Get up! Get them, you fools!!"
Thor, Hmm.
Thor," (shakes the tickets off to reveal a parking boot on the hammer) Oh, for crying out loud! (He tears the boot off and reaches the hammer out. Candace smiles and touches Mjolnir and giggles giddily.)"
Candace, (happy laughing)
Red Skull, (growls) I think perhaps our window of opportunity has closed.
Phineas," Well, Iron Man, looks like you're functioning at full capacity."
Iron Man, Yep. Why don't you kids take five? Enjoy the show.
Ferb," Oh, this is going to be sweet."
Phineas, Yeah it is!
Buford, Better?
Phineas," Hey, Hulk, that's using my head!"
Baljeet, Nice!
Phineas, (high fives Ferb) Wordplay!
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Huh? Thor!
Phineas, (to Candace) Hey.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Hey.
Phineas," So earlier, I really lost it. Uh, I'm sorry."
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," No, I'm sorry. I deserved it. Everything I did made things worse."
Phineas, It's okay. You were trying to help. And hello! You guys saved the day!
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Thanks!
Phineas, (taking out the repaired S.H.E.D. ID) So will you take your S.H.E.D. membership card back? I fixed it.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, (takes it) I accept.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," What? (she sees her mother walking by the wreckage) Is that Mom? You know I love you guys and I'm super glad we made up, but would you look at this place? Sorry, but you guys are so very extremely trouble busted!! Mom! (And there she goes again.)"
Nick Fury," Toss them in! Nice work, kids! You didn't just get back our heroes' powers. You showed true courage fighting alongside them! (renders a hand salute) S.H.I.E.L.D. owes you a debt of gratitude. (Phineas and Ferb return the salute.)"
Hot Dog Vendor," Yeah! Hot dogs for everyone, baby!"
Tour Guide, Three years later when the new day care center was built on top of the ancient burial ground...
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Mom! Mom Mom Mom! You gotta come back to the square!! The boys' and friends space satellite crashed down to Earth and these villains had a machine that would destroy the Tri-State Area and there's superheroes!! All in the square!! You gotta see it!
Linda, I'm surprised that's not on the tour.
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," No time for sarcasm, Mom! (grabs her) Come on!!"
Iron Man," Here's my direct line, Ferb. Internship, next summer? It'll be fun."
Spider-Man," Next time, Phin, the juice box'll be my treat. (web slings away)"
Phineas," You got it, Spidey!"
Baljeet," Uh, okay. (fist bumps Hulk)"
Hulk, Ow! Hmm. Ha ha! Gotcha!
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," Uh. Finally found an extension cord the right size! (plugs in the inator) Take that, bad guys! (The inator zaps the space station away and Candace appears just as it disappears.)"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, ...giant head shaped like Phineas and superheroes! But...but...but...
Linda Flynn-Fletcher," Oh, yes. There they are. (zoom out to reveal a comic book stand full of Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Ducky Momo comics)"
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn, Wha?
Linda Flynn-Fletcher," Hulk, Iron Man, Thor. All of them. I forgot you had a thing for comic books."
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," But but...This isn't how..Wait, where did..."
Linda Flynn-Fletcher, You wanna join me for the rest of the tour?
Candace Candy Gertrude-Flynn," No, I'd rather stay here and sulk."
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, I did it! Did anyone see that? Anyone? Anyone? No one's looking. Nobody's paying attention.
