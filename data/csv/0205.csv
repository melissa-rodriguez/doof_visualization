Phineas," There's our new pet Goldie. I wonder if we're as cute to her as she is to us? (Pause) Yeah, yeah we are. What can we do for Goldie since she's already done so much for us?"
Phineas," A marine-life aquarium? Great idea, Ferb! Let's build a best ever of one of these and give Goldie that special home she deserves. Does that sound good to you, Perry?"
Phineas," (At Goldie) So it's unanimous. Hey, where's Candace?"
Linda, Candace? Where are you? (Notices Candace) What are you doing?
Candace," Waiting for Jeremy to call! You see, last night, at the movies, he said was going to call soon. So I calculated that ""soon"" must mean first thing in the morning since ""soon"" can't refer to a period in excess of or equal to 24 hours, give or take a 59 minute cushion of time, on either side of the event in question. (Candace holds up a notepad of her math) See? I had it all figured out right here on this notepad. I even showed my math!"
Linda, Uh...
Candace, Wait! Maybe I should have carried the one instead of dividing by Jeremy's face...
Linda," Well, I'm off to my favorite author's book signing. Try not to freak out on your brothers while I'm gone."
Candace," Mom! I don't frea—Oh my gosh! The square root of ""soon"" is ""never""!"
Phineas," I got the filter done, how's the water coming?"
Ferb, (Thumbs up)
Woman, Herman! Are you taking a shower?
Herman, No.
Woman," (Pause) Well, you need one!"
Phineas," There you go, Goldie! Your new home! It's huge, it's amazing... it's lonely. We need to get her some new friends."
Boat captain," Say, aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel?"
Phineas," Why, yes. Yes we are."
Boat captain, Alright then.
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Oh, Agent P, uh, pardon the newspapers, but, uh, we have a lot of new young recruits coming through here today, and, well, they aren't, uh, trained yet. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased the entire Tri-State Area's supply of bratwurst. Get to the bottom of it. Oh, and, uh, watch your step on the way out."
Phineas," Goldie, how do you like your new friends?"
Phineas, NOOOOOOOOO!
Phineas," That was cool enough to be in one of those trained marine animal shows. Hmm...Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today."
Doofenshmirtz, (singsong) Yoo-hoo! Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz," Say hello to the Platypus Secret Agent Arrival In Order To Foil My Evil Plot Capture-inator! Or as I like to call it: my P.S.A.A.I.O.T.F.M.E.P.C.-inator. I made it up myself. Enough chit-chat! Let me tell you my latest evil scheme. You see, back before I was evil, I was something a little less than evil. I was a bratwurst street vendor."
Doofenshmirtz," What? They have those. See? Nobody remembers them. You know why? Because of the hot dog vendors! Oh, how I hated them! They had it all! They had chrome-plated carts and endorsement deals and fancy blimps! And what did we have? Only superior workmanship, finer meats, and exotic spices."
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) I was sure that it was just a matter of time before the public would recognize our superior quality.
Kid 1, How do you know when you're really lame?
Kid 2, When you sell bratwurst! (kids laugh)
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) Then and there, I swore..."
Doofenshmirtz (cont'd)," (walking up to a tarp) I would get my revenge. (uncovering the tarp) Behold, the Hot-Dog-Vendor-Revenge-inator! Or my H.D.V.R.....ina...I...I have to work on my acronyms. Here's how it works. (presses a remote button lowering a screen showing a slideshow) The Revenge-inator sets off a freon blast to an unsuspecting hot dog vendor encasing their hot water boilers in a sheet of ice and rendering their hot dogs cold and soggy. (He presses the remote again ending the slideshow and raising the screen back up) And once I've taken the hot out of the dog, they'll be forced to sell my bratwursts instead! (Perry rolls his eyes.) Don't roll your eyes at me! It's a good plan! (huffs and crosses his arms) Sorry to go off on you like that, Perry the Platypus, but sometimes you just, oh, really push my buttons!"
Candace," Oh, I can't take anymore! I'm just gonna call him!"
Candace," (looking out the window) Hey, what's with all these kids?"
Candace," That's what I thought! Phineas and Ferb! I've so got them this time! (She snaps a photo with her phone, but looks at it to see a lot of fists in the air.) I can't send that to Mom! 'Scuse me! Comin' through! One side!"
Man, Hey! No cuttin' in line!
Candace, It's my backyard! I outrank you!
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Goldie's Aqueous Extravaganza."
Candace, Uh-oh! Yaaaahh! (She lands in the aquarium.)
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, our sister, Candace!"
Candace, Phineas! Ablblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl...
Phineas," That's the spirit, Candace! Everybody!"
All, (wagging their tongues) Ablblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl...
Candace, MAKE THIS FISH PUT ME DOWN!!!
Phineas," It's a mammal, Candace!"
Candace, Meap.
Phineas," Way to go, Candace!"
Candace, How did I get in this fish show?!?!
Phineas, Mammal.
Candace, Whatever!
Phineas," Wow! You're a natural, Candace!"
Candace, AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Phineas," Hey, look at that! (an octopus swims by) Ferb, where did the octopus come from?"
Candace, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Candace, Must...take...picture! (She snaps a pic.) Send!
Linda," I've gotta tell you, I read your first book and I love it."
Bridgette Oshinomi, Do you have a high-strung teen at home?
Linda," Uh, you could say that. (her phone beeps) Ooh, this must be her."
Bridgette Oshinomi, She sent you a picture? Lemme see.
Linda, Well...okay.
Bridgette Oshinomi," How bad can it be? After all, I've been through with own— (She sees the picture of Candace freaking out) Oh. (gives the phone back to Linda) I think that you need the rest of the set. (gives two books) Uh, and why don't you take a whack at that first book again?"
Doofenshmirtz," And now, Perry the Platypus, (activating his inator) it is time for revenge! Goodbye, hot dog street ven— (Perry pushes Doof to the ground.) Oh, what the?! How did you get out of my trap? (Cut to reveal a wooden Perry in the trap with a tag saying ""DECOY"" on it.) A decoy? That doesn't even make any sense! But, okay, I surrender, I'm a reasonable man. (reaching around) I know when it's time to (grabs a bratwurst and whacks Perry with it) fight back! Waa-ha! (Perry wipes away the grease on his fur, takes off his fedora, and produces a hot dog from out of it.) Woo-ho-ho. Your hot dog is no match for my bratwurst!"
Doofenshmirtz," No, no, no, just kidding! I—But I made you look, didn't I? Huh? Huh?"
Candace," Wait a minute, is that Jeremy? What's he doing here? (Gets slapped by an orca tail.)"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace, did you get my messages?"
Candace," Messages? (Gets slapped by another orca tail and looks at her phone, while riding the dolphin.) Eleven messages? (Rides the dolphin, which goes through a hoop held up by Ferb.) He called me!"
Jeremy," Go, Candace!"
Doofenshmirtz," Not so hotsy-totsy now! Are you, Perry the Platypus?"
Computer, Fire.
Candace, He called me! I can't believe he really called me!
Candace," What happened to all the fish? (slips on the ice) Aaaaaaaahhh!!! (She falls and gets caught by Jeremy.) Oh, my!"
Jeremy, Wow! You were great back there!
Candace, Thanks!
Phineas," Great show, Ferb! I don't remember freezing the tank being part of the finale, but that rocked! Looks like it didn't freeze all the way through. Nice."
Doofenshmirtz," Eh, so what? Big deal. So it missed it's initial target. A minor setback. (Perry puts his finger on one of the bratwursts in the pile.) No wait! You'll disrupt the pile's equilibrium! (Perry takes the bratwurst out, nothing happens.) Well, hot diggity do— (All the bratwursts fall onto Doofenshmirtz and crash through the building and go down the streets.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!!"
Jeremy, I've been trying to call all day.
Candace, Uh... hehehehehehehehehehehe...
Jeremy, (puts her down) Do you wanna go do something?
Candace," Omigosh, yes! (She bends down, and her butt somehow causes the ice block to move, taking the stadium seats with it. Linda's station wagon parks.)"
Jeremy," Really, you didn't even look at your messages?"
Candace," Yeah, I know."
Jeremy," That's okay, Candace. You looked like you were pretty busy."
Candace, Mom!
Jeremy," Hi, Mrs. Flynn."
Linda," Hi, Jeremy."
Candace, You have to come to the backyard! (Pushes Linda into the backyard) Phineas and Ferb built a whole aquarium with whales and everything!
Jeremy, I'll call ya in a little while.
Candace, You'll see! (Closes eyes) Tada!!
Phineas," Hi, Mom!"
Linda," Look, honey! I brought ya a book."
Candace, Did Jeremy just say he'll call me in a little while? (gets out her phone and dials) How long is that supposed to be?!
Phineas," Well, I guess Goldie and her friends are headed to the ocean."
Ferb," Well, you know what they say, if you love something, set it free."
Phineas," Yeah, we do that every day with Perry. (Perry, also up in the tree, chatters.) Oh, there you are, Perry, we were just talkin' about you."
