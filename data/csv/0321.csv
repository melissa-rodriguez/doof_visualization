Phineas," Hey, Mom. Whatcha doin'?"
Linda," Hey, boys. I'm just working on my junk sculpture for the Modern Installations by Moms charity auction."
Phineas, Cool! Seen Dad?
Linda," Oh, he headed out for that speaking engagement of his."
Phineas," Aw, we're gonna shoot darts and we thought he might want to play around."
Linda, Maybe next time.
Candace, What a racket! Those guys are so busted.
Candace,I can't believe Mom isn't hearing this.
Linda," Wow, I've really got a knack for this modern art stuff. I need to go get more materials! (drops the blowtorch; runs off)"
Candace," So, mid-crime, huh?"
Candace,They'll be back.
Isabella," Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
Phineas," Oh, hey, Isabella! We're playing giant darts!"
Isabella, (flirtatiously) I bet you'll get a bulls-eye.
Phineas, (obliviously) Sure. Maybe not on the first try. It's all about little adjustments. And Buford and Baljeet are manning the target across town.
Baljeet, Tell me again how you are helping?
Buford, (lounging on a beach chair) I'm supervisin'!
Phineas," All right, here we go! Elevation, 33 degrees. Three, two, one..."
Isabella, Have fun!
Linda," Hi, Isabella."
Isabella," Hi, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher."
Phineas," With our current velocity and wind resistance, we should be nearing the target in no time."
Phineas, Whoops! Better retract the launch mechanism.
Lawrence," Let's see, where to. Ah, yes. 9019, Palindrome Road."
Lawrence," Oh! That was close. (rights the car back up) Whoops! Dropped my address. (picks up the paper) Well, (places paper on the sun visor) 6106, Palindrome Road, here I come!"
Baljeet, Phineas and Ferb at ten o'clock!
Phineas, Oops. Outer ring. We'll try again.
Buford," Zero. Write that down, Baljeet."
Baljeet," Oh, yes, by all means, I do not want to forget to add zero later."
Phineas," Hey, I meant to ask you earlier. Where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. Our sources tell us that the members of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.,"
Major Monogram,"the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness,"
Major Monogram,"are about to gather to elect their new leader. But we don't know where or how. See if you can gain access, and we'll survey the situation remotely through your wrist communicator."
Candace," (on her cell phone) Mom, you've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb made. I don't know what it is, but it looks horrible."
Linda, I'll be home right after I finish my errands.
Candace, But you gotta come home now before it disappears!
Linda, (imitating static) What's that? You're breaking up! (imitates static)
Candace, Wait! Mom! (growls) I hates when she does... (imitates static) ...but it doesn't matter. I'm not going anywhere.
Doofenshmirtz, (laughs) Right in there.
Doofenshmirtz,"You've heard of a ship in a bottle? Well, you're Perry the Platypus in a bottle. (picks up bottle) Anyway, today is the day I become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! You remember L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally... (mumbling) Whatever?"
Doofenshmirtz,Huh? Remember them?
Doofenshmirtz,"Well, we gotta moving. (holds up bottle) Maybe we'll get some hot dogs or something on the way. (walks off) You like hot dogs, right?"
Candace, (gasps; stands up) That came from the front yard! (runs off) Phineas and Ferb!
Candace, A-ha! Huh?
Linda, Feathers. It needs feathers.
Candace, (gasps) Oh. My. Gosh.
Lawrence," (stops his car) Well, this is the place."
Lawrence," Yes, um, I'm supposed to be onstage?"
Man," (puts paper down) They're about to get started. (pushes Lawrence towards stage) Go, go, go!"
Rodney," I am Rodney, and I am from the great state of South Dakota, home of beautiful Mt. Rushmore... For now!"
Doofenshmirtz," ""I'm Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and I like unicorns and rainbows..."" Wait, who switched my..."
Rodney, (laughs)
Diminutive, I'm Dr. Diminutive and I don't have a Napoleon complex. Napoleon had a me complex! Don't cross me!
Diminutive, You can't do that!
Diminutive, Why?
Lawrence," Excuse me, is this the way to the stage?"
Announcer, It looks like we have a late entry!
Baljeet, Phineas and Ferb at ten o'clock again!
Phineas," Awesome! Triple ring, triple score!"
Buford," Yeah, but in the one-point wedge. Three points, Baljeet."
Baljeet, When do I get to supervise?
Buford, Don't hold your breath.
Candace," No one comes in, no one goes..."
Candace,Forget it. I'm not moving.
Phineas," (off screen) Okay, Ferb, let's reset and adjust both axes by five degrees."
Candace, (groans) I can't stand it! (runs off)
Candace, Ha!
Candace, (closes door) I'm gonna bust you yet!
Linda, Now to the butcher for the finishing touch.
Candace, What the...?
Announcer," Welcome to the first annual L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Pageant of Evil,..."
Lawrence, (oblivious to what's going on) I thought I was already confirmed. Prepared my speech and everything.
Announcer, In addition to gaining total control of the iron...
Announcer,our contestants will each receive a commemorative flashlight...
Major Monogram," (on wristwatch communicator) Agent P, it's come to our attention that Lawrence Fletcher, from your host family, has somehow entered the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Supreme Ruler Pageant."
Major Monogram,"Of course, considering his genial nature,..."
Announcer," Remember, points will be awarded by the audience,..."
Announcer,"Our first evil event, the mechanical mother."
Announcer,"Show us how you treat the old lady, Larry!"
Lawrence," Wish me luck, boys. (at the mechanical mother) Hello, old dear, so lovely to see you. (bows) I've brought you some peonies. (pulls out a bouquet)"
Mechanical mother," Oh, such a nice boy."
Rodney, I didn't think anyone could be more incompetent at being evil than you.
Doofenshmirtz, Me neither.
Announcer," And now, he's serving her tea without a trace of irony!"
Lawrence," (as he walks back) Remember to keep that foot elevated. (to the other two) What a lovely, old girl."
Rodney, Prepare yourself for a stunning display of filial beastliness. (walks away)
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, knock yourself out, Rodney."
Rodney," (holding a present; at the mechanical mother) Hello, Mother. (kneels on one knee) I've brought you something special!"
Mechanical mother, For me? (opens present) You're such a good...
Announcer, Ooh! Dirty laundry!
Announcer,And there go the waterworks.
Rodney," (chuckles) Yeah. That's how it's done, boys."
Mechanical Mother, Oh! My baby still needs me!
Rodney, Huh?
Announcer," Oh, no! Tears of joy? Zero points for that move!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, you monster. Watch and learn, Rodney. (clears throat; at mechanical mother) I am getting married again."
Announcer," Audience, get your votes in, please."
Lawrence," (at a smug Doofenshmirtz) I don't know how you did it! I don't even think I understood the event, but good show!"
Announcer," And we're back with everyone's favorite, the swimwear competition! Here comes Lawrence Fletcher..."
Announcer,Next up is Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, I thought this was the talent competition! (skates off balance; falls head first into a toilet; muffled yelling) It won't stop flushing!"
Announcer," (pause) And last is Rodney in his... (curtain opens) Oh, my gosh!"
Rodney, (growls)
Rodney," (leaps out of tank; removes rubber mask) Technically, it is a swimsuit."
Candace, Meat? What possible functionality could that have?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, come on, Rodney, the last event's about to... What? Wait, that's my Make-Everything-Evil-inator!"
Rodney," No, Doofy, it's my Make-Everything-Evil-izer. It's an -Izer."
Doofenshmirtz," You're a jerk, you know that?"
Rodney, Yes! And I'm going to be more of one when I zap myself with this! (pulls on a lever) I'll be so evil there'll be no way I can lose!
Doofenshmirtz, (quickly sits on Rodney's lap) I'll zap me first!
Rodney, You broke my Izer!
Doofenshmirtz, Inator! Inator!
Rodney, Shut it!
Doofenshmirtz," No, you shut it!"
Lawrence, Have you seen these flashlights...AAH!
"Rodney, Doofenshmirtz", Uh-oh.
Delivery Man," Excuse us. We're here to take, uh this... thing away."
Candace, (stands up from lawn) What? No!
Delivery Man," Sorry, kid. We got a work order right here."
Candace, No! No!
Announcer," And now the final event where each of our three contestants will attempt to intimidate the others with only the force of his evil glare. Contestants, take your marks."
Announcer,Get set. And begin!
Announcer,The voting has started! Look at those fingers go!
Announcer,Rodney is off to an early lead. It's the pointy-ear advantage! But wait! What's this?
Announcer,Fletcher has his eyes covered. He's not even trying!
Announcer, This could be a real opportunity for Doofenshmirtz!
Announcer,He leers at Rodney. Rodney returns it. With a point! A classic gambit!
Announcer,The scores are really ticking up now and... Wait! There's a stirring in the Fletcher corner.
Announcer,Something's happening...
Doofenshmirtz, Such evil!
Rodney, (shielding his face) Oh! My eyes!
Announcer, And the crowd is going wild! Fletcher's numbers are skyrocketing!
Major Monogram," (on wristwatch communicator) Agent P, our sensors reveal that Lawrence Fletcher has been shot with a Make-Everything-Evil-izer. If he should become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., we will have no choice but to reassign you. You must find a way to snap him out of it. Remind him of his true, good nature. Remind him who he used to be!"
Phineas," (off screen) This is the one, Bro. I can feel it."
Announcer," I now present to you, the new supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., Lawrence Fletcher!"
Lawrence," Today, Danville! Tomorrow, the world! (chuckling)"
Doofenshmirtz," We have term limits in L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., right?"
Rodney, Nope.
Lawrence, (laughs evilly)
Phineas, Bull's-eye!
Phineas, I think that's Dad.
Ferb, What was the topic of his lecture again?
Phineas," Hi, Dad!"
Lawrence, (taking off medal; flings it away) Phineas! Ferb! What are you doing here?
Lawrence," (shaking Phineas's hand) Brilliant shot, by the way."
Phineas," Aah, it's all about little adjustments."
"Doofenshmirtz, Rodney", Mine! Mine! Mine!
Rodney, It's mine!
Doofenshmirtz, Ooh! I hate you!
Phineas," (as he, Ferb, and Lawrence walk away) So, how'd it go, Dad?"
Lawrence," I'm not absolutely sure, boys, but I think I just became ""King of the Pharmacists""."
Phineas," Awesome! (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry."
Candace, (grunts) No! Not until Mom has seen it.
Delivery Man," Sorry, miss, I got a job to do."
Linda, Candace is right. Because it's not done yet.
Linda," There. Take it away, guys. That junk sculpture should bring in big bids at the auction. (climbs down the flatbed)"
Candace, (in surprise) Junk sculpture?! (stuttering)
Linda," Honestly, Candace, it's not like lip-synching is my only talent."
Candace, (continues stuttering)
Linda," Well, now you're just being rude...."
