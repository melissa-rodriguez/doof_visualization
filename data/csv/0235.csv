Lawrence," (To three songbirds) Look at that, my fine feathered friends! (He mounts his handiwork onto the tree trunk) Not a bad bit of work, even if I do say so myself. Just wait till you see the hidden surprise. (He pushes a red button on the front of the bird house, which bears the words 'home tweet home'. Its walls spring outward, revealing various miniature items including a fountain and a spiral staircase) Oh, nothing? Not even a sausage? No matter. (He pushes the button once again and the birdhouse folds back to its normal state) Wait until Linda and the kids see it. It'll blow their tiny minds. Well, not their tiny minds, that's not fair."
Announcer, You're watching the UNcovery Channel. We now return to Rrrrr?
Narrator," (The camera shifts to the boys who are watching the television show intently) Many believe that in the 1950s, a UFO crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico, but the scientists had no idea what the advanced technology was or how it worked. To find out, they used a process called reverse engineering. By closely examining the individual parts, they were able to build their own craft and figure out what it does, and how it does what it does. Way to go, reverse engineering! The reverse engineering craze reached its zenith in 1982 when new wave band Zanzibar released their smash reverse engineering-related hit, ""What Do It Do?"""
Band Member," ♪ ...Do do, do do do... ♪"
Phineas," Cool! Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Hey, Carl, where's Agent P?"
Carl," Oh, he came in early today, sir."
Major Monogram," He did? Heh. Well, good for him. Well, I guess we're done. I'm going home."
Carl," Me, too?"
Major Monogram," No, not you."
Doofenshmirtz," Ha! Close, but no... Cigar! See, Perry the Platypus, my new jet rocket skiff has more hidden traps than... (Snaps fingers) Um, uh—What's something with a lot of hidden traps? Huh, wow, I felt so confident going into that sentence. Man, okay. Anyway, you might be wondering why I got such an early start on my evil scheme today. You see, my dating life has been a seemingly endless series of disappointments. It all started at a drive-in movie."
Radio Announcer," You were listening to: ""That's Wings, You Turkey"" by King of Loud. And here's a new one from Zanzibar: ""What Do It Do?"""
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) And I never saw her again.
Doofenshmirtz," Oddly enough, she did become a pop star later! I'm still struggling with the whole Tri-State Area thing, but y'know, the dream is alive. (walking to the other side) Anyway, they recently reopened that drive-in, dredging up all these unpleasant memories for me. So, naturally, I built this. (He gets trapped, and trips, causing the huge device to fall off the rocket-powered jet skiff.) Oh, really?! Really?!!"
Candace," Okay, Mom, I've gotta get to Stacy's! Love ya! Bye! Oop! (sees the device) Mom Mom! Mom!! C'mere! Look what Phineas and Ferb made in the front yard! Quick!"
Linda," Oh, yeah. You're in such a— (zoom in on Linda's shocked expression) The boys built that?!"
Candace, (excitedly) Yes! They're always making crazy things like this! See?! See?!
Linda, What is it?!
Candace," Well, obviously, it's a— Why don't you ask/bust them?!"
Phineas, Ask/bust us what?
Linda, Do you mind telling me what this is and why you built it in our front yard?!
Phineas," Um...we didn't build this, Mom."
Candace, Ha! Quick! Bust 'em—Wait. You didn't?
Phineas, Not that I'm aware of. no. Ferb? (Ferb shakes his head.)
Linda, No one is going anywhere until we figure out what this is and where it came from!
Phineas, Hmmm... Let's see what this red button's all about—
Linda, Don't...touch it! (Candace and Phineas look at their mother while their attempting to touch it. Ferb has his shoe off and attempts to press it with his foot.) Nobody touches it! I'm calling your father.
Phineas," Hey, Ferb, reverse engineering, huh? Uh? I know what we're gonna do today!"
Candace," Think again, Bucko! Mom said ""No touchee-touchee!"""
Phineas," We don't need to touchee-touchee. We have a portable electronic scanner, gumption, and another portable electronic scanner."
Candace," Well, I'll be watching you closely, so don't think you can get one—"
Phineas," All done, Ferb? Cool! Let's get reverse engineering!"
Lawrence," And here's the 17th century Whiskershire spring stick, which belonged to the Earl of Whiskershire. (A man dressed in royal garments and a mouse costume appears on screen. Lawrence's phone rings.) Oh, 'scuse me for a second. Hullo."
Linda," Honey, do you know about the thing in the front yard?"
Lawrence," (referring to the birdhouse) Oh, yes, of course I do, honey. I made it myself. Do you like it?"
Linda, You...made that?!
Lawrence," Ahem. Look, darling, I'm in the middle of something right here, so I'll have to phone you back."
Linda, (on phone) But—
Lawrence," Okay, honey, but don't press the red button on it, will you? I want to be there when you see it, okay?"
Linda," Well, okay, but I'm really not very comfortable with—"
Lawrence," (on phone) Cheers, love! Bye!"
Doofenshmirtz," You know, in retrospect, I probably went a little overboard with the traps on this thing. Alright, I'm gonna try to reach the release switch for the trap holding your arms. Then you try to reach the steering wheel and change our course away from Mount Kilimanjaro. Interesting trivia..."
Doofenshmirtz (cont'd)," (like a cheesy tour guide) Mount Kilimanjaro is actually comprised of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Shira, and the one that we're about to crash into, Mawenzi. Cool, huh? (Doof struggles to get to the button until finally pressing it.) There! Oh. Oh, that wasn't the release. Who knows what that did?"
Doofenshmirtz," (reaching for the bottom button) This one should be the right—Okay...I....got it! (Perry gets released) Quick! (Perry jumps onto a cage and steers the skiff away from Mawenzi. He falls backwards and gets trapped...again.) You know, Perry the Platypus, I just— A golf course! A golf course has a lot of traps in it! That's what I shoulda said."
Linda," Well, it turns out your father is responsible for this—Hold on, is it...buzzing?"
Candace," Yes. Yes, it is."
Linda," Okay, stay calm! (grabs and drags her daughter) Just move away from it!"
Phineas," Friends, bullies, Irving, at 0900 hours, a UCO (or Unidentified Crashing Object) landed in our front yard. We reverse engineered a piece-by-piece duplicate of the strange object. We have called you here to help us discover what this object is and how it works."
Zanzibar, ♪ What'cha gonna does when you don't know what it do? ♪
Lawrence," Soon, the entire village of Whiskershire began following the Earl's lead to, of course... (phone rings again) Uh, do forgive me. I-I-I'm awfully sorry. Hello?"
Linda," Lawrence, you have to come home right now! This thing is freakin' me out!"
Lawrence," Uh, L-Linda, my dear, I love you, but you couldn't have chosen a worse moment to go completely bonkers! I'm sorry, but I've got to call you back! Bye!"
Linda," (very Candace-esque) Ohhhh, he doesn't believe me!! He said I sound crazy!!"
Candace," (gasps in realization) Ohhhhh, reeeeeeally???"
Linda, Yeah! You know I'm not imagining this!
Candace," Of course not! Gosh, that must be so frustrating to have someone not believe you when you're telling the truth!"
Linda," Oh, you don't know the half of it."
Candace," That feeling you have right now: that's how I feel every single day when you don't believe me about what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Now that you finally understand, would you come with me to the backyard?"
Linda, Why?
Candace," Now, keep in mind how Dad just made you feel, okay? Phineas and Ferb have reverse-engineered and built an exact duplicate of this thing and at this very moment, they're trying to figure out what it does by forcing it to belly dance and work in a library. (smiles)"
Linda," Candace, honey, I love you, but you couldn't have chosen a worse moment to go completely bonkers!"
Doofenshmirtz," (yelling below) Pierre!! (giggles to Perry) Did anyone look? A-hee-hee-hee! I betcha, like, half the people down there are looking around, like (fake French accent) ""Who called my name?"" (laughs in his normal voice)"
Baljeet," You know, Isabella, I sometimes wonder if it was mere coincidence that it was you and I chosen to portray the young, happy couple."
Isabella," ""Chosen?"" Baljeet, you charged to that empty chair like a crazed wolf."
Phineas," Ah, here we are, madame and monsieur."
Phineas, And what can I get for you this afternoon?
Phineas," Ah-buh-bup! (the device stops) Give. (The device approaches Phineas, bowing apologetically, and gives him the candle.) Hmm... Interesting."
Linda," Okay, there's been no change in the last ten minutes. I should call your father."
Candace," You know, Mom, I understand. Obviously, you're not gonna come see what Phineas and Ferb are up to until this is resolved. So here's what we're gonna do! First of all, no more calling Dad! If I don't convince you to come home to bust the boys after a couple of calls, I go get you!"
Linda, But what if he doesn't wanna come with me?
Candace, Did that ever stop me?
Lawrence," This statue, which stands outside the Whiskershire Rectory, still holds the Earl's actual spring stick, yes. The spring stick is used as such: it's placed in front of you so as to spring the hidden mousetraps to avoid capture. Now some suggest—"
Linda," Move it, Fletcher!"
Lawrence," Oh, any questions?"
Doofenshmirtz," (offscreen) Ah, the quaint town of Whiskershire. It's a great place to fly nilly-willy through, manacled to a rocket skiff this time of year."
Phineas," Friends, bullies, Irving, we've reached our conclusion as to the purpose of the object that landed in our front yard. We believe that it is an anti-romance rocket created to scan for, and then eliminate romantic elements from potentially amorous situations."
"Isabella, Baljeet and Irving", Ohhhhhh.
Buford, So it's not a wedgie machine?
Linda, Hehehehehehehehehehehehe...
Candace," (on the phone) Hehehehehehehehehehehehe... This is gonna be awesome, Stace! So when they get home, I'm gonna drag both of them into the backyard and it'll be a busting feeding frenzy!!!"
Candace (cont'd)," (dancing crazily) ♪ Bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water ♪"
Doofenshmirtz," W-W-Wait a minute! Perry the Platypus, where are you—? Oh!"
Doofenshmirtz," Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Candace," ♪ Bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water ♪"
Barry White soundalike," ♪ Oh, yeah. I like the way the sunlight glistens off your chrome ♪"
Phineas, Wow. Two anti-romance rockets falling in love.
Buford," That's what I call ""ironing""."
Candace," ♪ It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water ♪"
Linda, There! Tell me that's not terrifying!
Lawrence, (looking at his daughter) I'm so sorry I doubted you.
Candace, ♪ Going down down down at the busting feeding frenzy stay out of the water!!! ♪
Linda," (overlapping) Wait...But...Candace, where did that thing go?"
Candace," (stops dancing) Hmmm. I don't know! But, Mom, you and Dad hafta come to the backyard with me right now and see what the boys are— (Sees the two devices rocketing over the house leaving a puff of smoke in the shape of a heart. She sighs.) Nevermind."
Isabella, I wonder what would make someone want to build something to destroy romance in the first place.
Ferb," Well, if you reverse-engineer the human heart, you're bound to find love at its core."
Buford, And...gross smushy red stuff!
Ferb, Yes. Love and gross smushy red stuff.
Irving, And ventricles!
Ferb," Actually, I think ventricles are already included in gross smushy red stuff."
All but Ferb, Yeah.
