Ferb, We know it's a little weird.
Girl 1," Help, help! Is there a doctor in the house?"
Baljeet," I am a doctor. (Baljeet rips his clothes off, revealing a doctor's scrubs) And yes, I am single. What seems to be the problem here?"
Girl 1, I think I sprained my ankle.
Baljeet, And you want me to take a look at it?
Girl 1," No, I want your brain."
Girl 2, Brains!
Everyone from the beach, Brains!
Girl 1, Brain.
Baljeet," Shape-shifting alien zombies, fair enough, but I must tell you that I am kind of using my brain right now."

Suzy," Norm, if you're going to live here, you can't just wander into Jeremy's room like this! What if he found out about you? Then, he'd make you return to outer space!"
Norm," Space is cold and unforgiving, like my father!"
Suzy," Oh, no! It's Jeremy! Quick, hide!"
Jeremy, Suzy? Is that you? What are you doing in my room?
Suzy, (opens door to Jeremy) I was just making you a surprise.
Jeremy, A surprise? What is it?

Narrator, Poor Ducky Momo. Are you lost?
Ducky Momo, (quacks)
Man," Yes, you are. Ducky Momo needs to get to the other side of the Dumbledown River. Can you help him find the Butter-Berry Bridge?"
Kids," (Off screen) Behind you Ducky Momo! It's behind you! Yeah, right there! Right there, Ducky Momo! It's right there! It's right there! Behind you! Right there behind you! Behind you, and to the left. Your other left! Right ther- Behind you! Behind you! No the other way. Oh for Pete's sake!"
Girl 3," Uh-oh, Dr. Baljeet! Who are they?"
Baljeet," Just some old friends. In post-apocalyptic battle gear. Okay, maybe ""friends"" is stretching it a bit."
Girl 3, Jeepers!
Baljeet," GI hope you have got your carry on stowed, because we are ready for take-off."
Trucker 1," Dude, you are so lucky."
Trucker 2," Yeah, I know. I gotta slow down."

Girl 3, What?
Baljeet," It is Dr. Ninja Baljeet. You left off the ""ninja"" part."
Girl 3, Really?

Man 1," You know, the guys on these sports team have some pretty funny names these days."
Man 2," Yeah, like those hockey players."
Man 1," No, no, those are just Canadian names."
Man 2," How about these jugglers, folks?"
Suzy, (As she puts makeup on Norm) You're much more fun than my other dolls.
Norm, I'm honored!
Suzy, Yes. What do you think? (shows Norm a mirror)
Norm, Self-interest dictates a tactful reply.
Jeremy, (Knocks on Suzy's door) Suzy? Are you there?
Suzy," Yeah, just a sec! (To Norm) Quick, hide! (goes to open the door, shushes Norm, opens door)"
Jeremy," (walks into room) Hey, sis. I can't find my lucky baseball bat. I've looked everywhere. Have you seen it?"
Suzy," Uh... (She sees Norm, who is wearing a lampshade on his head and moves over so that Jeremy does not see him) Nope. Nothing in here that would be of any interest to you."
Jeremy," Suzy, you're acting kinda weird. You're not hiding anything, are you?"
Suzy, No. (the siblings stare at each other) Get out of my room!
Jeremy, Holy guacamole! You sure are a handful. (He leaves)
Norm, (removes lampshade) Look at me! I'm the life of the party!
Suzy, My lamp needs a brighter bulb.
Guilbaud," Of course I'm a-prepared. I can de-bone herring in thirty-eight seconds, and I can make five minute frosting in four minutes! (chuckles) Look out, Van Stomm. Chef Guilbaud is coming for you!"
Buford, Who puts tofu on lasagna?!
Guilbaud," I was just trying to be avantguard, Che--"
Buford," Yeah, people need to be ""ava-guarded"" from your food! (kicks plate)"
Guilbaud," Clearly, I have much to learn. (sobbing)"
Roger," I don't know, Katt Karr. We've been all over Metroburg, and still no sign of the sinister Professor Nibbles. Got any ideas?"
Roger," Saucer of milk? Okay, I don't see how that's gonna help, but you're the car."
Jeremy," Hey, Suzy. What are you doing out here, and what's with the lumpy table?"
Suzy," Oh, uh, it's my lemonade stand."
Jeremy, Lemonade stand? Where's the lemonade?
Suzy, I... drink-ded it.
Jeremy, Holy guacamole! You sure are a handful. (He leaves)
Norm, I made more lemonade!
Suzy, About time! We just lost a customer! Now help me fix this lumpy table!
Buford," Look, some people tend to think I'm a bit harsh with these guys. But here's how I see it. DISGUSTING! UTTER GARBAGE! RAW SEWAGE ON A PLATE! It's really all about nurturing the talent."
Roger," We've almost caught up with Professor Nibbles, Katt Karr."
Roger," Bad Katt Karr! Bad Katt Karr! No, No!"
Man, Poor Ducky Momo. Still can't find the bridge? Can you help him find the bridge?
Ducky Momo, (quacks)
Kids," Behind you! It's behind you! Oh, for crying out loud, Just turn around! Rotate your body! No, not that way! Where are you going?! The bridge is right here by us! We can see it from here!"
Boy," Boy, I'm hungry."

Meap, Meap!

Man, No!

Baljeet, There is nothing to worry about way out here!
Jeremy," Well, I guess he's really gone, Suzy. You've got to admit, he was a lot of trouble. But deep down, I'm gonna miss that big guy. Come on, let's go inside."
Suzy, I'll be in in a minute.
Jeremy, Okay. (He leaves)
Suzy," Okay he's gone, you can come out now!"
Norm," That's great, because I've got fireworks!"
Suzy, Holy guacamole! You sure are a handful. (She winks and Norm does the same)
Guilbaud," It wasn't to what Chef Van Stomm was saying. It was how he was saying it. So, I decided to take his teachings to heart."
Buford, And I couldn't be prouder!
Reporter," Huge meteor to impact the Earth at 9 o'clock tonight. Also, who's this little fella, and why is he in a bookcase? We'll have this story at ten."
Roger," Well, Nibbles, it looks like you're caught like a rat in a trap. And you'll have plenty of time to gnaw on that in the state prison. And you'll be a rat in a, you'll, well... You know what? I'm out of rat metaphors. Anyway, thanks for all your help, Katt Karr."
Roger," Oh, let's pretend like didn't see that."
Kids," What is he looking at?! That's not a bridge! What is that? That's a candy wrapper, not a bridge! Oh great! Look at this! Now, where's he going?! Get back here! Where did he go? Where did he go? How has he survives this long?"
Baljeet," So, it turned out that the invasion was all just a big misunderstanding."
Girl 4," So, does that mean we're safe now?"
Baljeet, That all depends. Do you want more carbonated goulash?
Girl 4, I don't get it.
Phineas, So! What do you think of Ferb TV?
Candace," (pause, stands up) I'm telling Mom. (She leaves to do so)"
Phineas, I think she liked it.
Candace," (Enters with Linda) Right here Mom, right on top of our -- (There's nothing there) taaaaa..."
Linda," Again, what am I looking at?"
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry! Holy guacamole! You sure are a handful!"
