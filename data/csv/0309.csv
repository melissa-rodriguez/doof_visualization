Reynolds," Hello, Tri-State Area. This is Al Reynolds reporting from the Danville Zoo. I'm here with Tykera Kwok and the zoo's latest acquisition. (at Tykera) Tykera, what is this thing? It looks like a beaver-duck."
Tykera," No, this is a platypus."
Reynolds, (on TV) A platypus?
Phineas," Hey, he looks like you, Perry."
Tykera, (on TV) That's right.
Phineas," Of course, he doesn't look nearly as smart."
Reynolds," Well, what does it do?"
Tykera, Not much. He does like sandwiches though.
Reynolds," (chuckles) So, got anything for the hundreds and thousands of people about to change the channel on me might find remotely interesting?"
Tykera," Well, over here we've some pelicans and a baby rhino."
Delivery Man 1, What's that smell?
Delivery Man 2, That's my sandwich. I left it back at the truck.
Delivery Man 1," No, I mean that other smell."
Delivery Man 2," Oh, that's you."
Delivery Man 1," Oh yeah, right."
Candace," Hi, Mom."
Linda," Hi, Candace."
Linda," (on her cell phone) I'm doing the shopping, do you need anything?"
Candace," (via cell phone) No, I'm good."
Linda, The boys said they'd have fun at home so go out and do something instead of waiting around for Jeremy to call.
Candace," I do stuff! Uh-oh, call waiting. Bye! (presses a button) Hi, Jeremy."
Jeremy, I just called to let you know I'll be at the big pet wash at the park today.
Candace, Pet wash?
Jeremy," Yeah. Instead of cars, we wash pets for charity. You know, you can really..."
Candace," Wait. Hang on, Jeremy. (at Perry) Okay, eww! Off the couch, go on. Get out of here."
Candace," You heard me. Hit the road, meat brick."
Candace, (at Jeremy) You were saying?
Jeremy, I was saying you can really tell a lot about a person by the way they treat animals.
Candace, True.
Jeremy," Hey, why don't you bring Perry to the park and we can wash him together? Sound like fun?"
Candace," Yeah. Okay, see you there. (closes cell phone) Oh, Perry! Come here, you little meat brick."
Phineas," Ferb, I've been thinking. Since there's nothing more fun than fun, why no add fun to everything?"
Phineas," Fun shoes, fun oatmeal,..."
Phineas," ...fun origami. Well, origami's already fun. Fun... (close-up of Ferb's face) house! Great idea, Ferb! We'll turn our house into a fun house, by you know, adding fun."
Candace," Hey, guys, where's Perry?"
Phineas, I think he went that way. (points to the left)
Candace," Oh, there you are, Perry. (picks Perry up)"
Candace, (walking past them) I'm borrowing your platypus.
Phineas," (opens his eyes) Okay, have fun."
Candace, Will you stop squirming? You're a platypus. It's not like you have anywhere you need to be!
Major Monogram," Where's Agent P? You set off the wrist beacon, right, Carl?"
Carl," I'm worried too, sir. So I thought I'd make myself useful by modifying his chair. I added a hidden button so the chair will automatically go to Doofenshmirtz's. Then automatically return here. (laughs) Everything's Agent P sized here. It's kind of cute, like kindergarten."
Delivery Man 1," Sign here, please."
Phineas," Let me guess, you guys just delivered to the zoo?"
Delivery Man 1," Oh, yes. Yes, we did."
Phineas, I thought I detected a hint of western lowland gorilla.
Delivery Man 1," (sighing) No. No, that's me."
Phineas," Oh. Sorry, dude."
Delivery Man 1," (while walking away) That's okay, I'm learning to live with it."
Phineas," Yeesh. I could learn a thing or two from you about talking less. (pulls out blueprint; opens it) Now let's see. The hall of mirrors obviously goes in the hall, but where should we put the liquid nitrogen room?"
Major Monogram," What is taking Agent P so long?(notices the sandwich) Carl, what is in that sandwich?"
Carl," (gulps; pause) Peanut butter, banana, and sardines."
Major Monogram," Oh, for Pete's sake, I can see the smell from here. Put it down and test all the outside portals. Maybe the doors are stuck or something."
Carl," Okay, sir. (places sandwich on console; pulls down a lever)"
Carl, Seems like it's working just...
Carl," Oh, there you are, Agent P."
Major Monogram," Thank goodness. (pause) You're in the way, Carl."
Carl," Oh. Sorry, sir. (walks to the right)"
Major Monogram," Agent P, we were... Wait a minute. (close-up of the zoo platypus) You're not in uniform, agent. Where is your hat?"
Computerized voice, Auto hat activated.
Major Monogram," That's better. Sorry to be so harsh, Agent P, but today is a very special day. Your 100th battle with Dr. Doofenshmirtz."
Carl, (blows noisemaker)
Major Monogram, We planted hundreds of hidden cameras in Evil Incorporated (image of D.E.I. shows on monitor) so that we here at headquarters can watch the historic event and also enjoy some cheap laughs. (chuckles)
Doofenshmirtz, (on monitor) ♪ Shangri-La! You live forever here in Shangri-Laaaa! ♪
Major Monogram," We've got hours of that, hours. Now, do us proud, Agent P."
Jeremy," Man, look at all these pet lovers."
Candace," Yeah, my peeps."
Jeremy," You ready for your bath, huh, boy? Who loves Candace? Oh, who's a beautiful boy? Who loves Candace?"
Jeremy, (offscreen) What do you need? What do you need? You know what you need?
Candace, What do I need?
Jeremy, (offscreen) A bath.
Candace," (quickly opens her eyes) What? (realizes) Oh, yeah, right. Right. Right. Perry."
Candace," What's wrong with you, Perry? Don't you wanna get clean, you dirty little... (Perry kicks her; she lets go of him) Whoops! Where'd he go?"
Jeremy," (while Perry quickly reverts to pet mode) I think he's behind that tree. (picks Perry up, who chatters again; hands him to Candace) See, he's glad you found him."
Candace," Yeah, me too."
Reynolds, (on TV) It looks like the zoo's new beaver-duck has escaped.
Doofenshmirtz," Eh, local news. (turns TV off with a remote) All summer long, we have this standing appointment and suddenly Mr. Big Shot can't be troubled to... (screams; spills his coffee)"
Monogram," Hurry up, Carl. The fight's about to begin."
Doofenshmirtz, (on TV) Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz, So kind of you to finally show up (pushes the button on the remote) and demolish my wall.
Doofenshmirtz, (tosses the remote) Gotcha!
Doofenshmirtz,"Behold, the Least-Likely-inator! All I have to do is zap someone with this baby and they can't help but do the least likely thing to their nature. (activates the Least-Likely-inator and a red ray comes out of it) Ooh, touchy."
Isabella," Hey, Irving. Did you hear? Phineas and Ferb are building a fun house."
Irving," Really? (gets zapped by the ray; leans against an imaginary lamp post) Who cares? I'm too cool for those losers. Say, you're cute. (falls over) There used to be a lamp post there."
Doofenshmirtz," So what am I gonna do with the Least-Likely-inator, you ask? Make my daughter obey me? Make my father love me? No, and double no! ...Well, maybe later."
Doofenshmirtz,"But first, I'm gonna aim this bad boy at City Hall and zap my brother the mayor. And he'll make a fool of himself in front of the legislature, which is the least likely thing he'd ever do. And the city will be forced to give the Tri-State Area to me, his next of kin! And don't tell me democracy doesn't work like that, Perry the Platypus. (covers his ears) I don't wanna hear it."
Doofenshmirtz," (uncovers his ears; turns around) Perry the Platypus, you escaped already?"
Doofenshmirtz,"No, don't do that! I haven't vacuumed here in weeks."
Phineas, Whee! Wall slide's working.
Buford," Hey, Dinnerbell, where do you want the clown head?"
Phineas," Clown room. (at Isabella) Hey, Isabella, how's that hall of cookies coming?"
Isabella," Great, but I had to double the recipe."
Phineas," Hey, Ferb, how's the basement spin?"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, down on all fours! I know that fighting technique. (gets down on all fours) It's Singapore Crab! I learnt in Hoboken. (moves back and forth; stands up; imitates a crab) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna sidewalk all over you, baby."
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I see what you're doing. You're messing with my head. Trying to get into my mind. Walk around in there, rearrange the furniture..."
Doofenshmirtz, (on TV) ...maybe repaint the kitchen.
Major Monogram," Take note, Carl. You're watching a master agent at work. (eats some popcorn)"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're in for it."
Doofenshmirtz,"Served with butter! (imitates a crab again; chuckles; zoo platypus walks by him; gets down on all fours) Hey, where'd you..."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, that's my sandwich display case."
Carl," Get him, Agent P!"
Doofenshmirtz," A fake-out, eh? (gets out from under the fallen display stand) Okay, Perry the Platypus, the claws are off now. From here on in, I fight the man style!"
Doofenshmirtz, (muffling) Okay. I see you found the brick wall.
Major Monogram," Oh, the Marsh Maneuver. Well, I haven't seen one of those since 1974."
Carl, 1974? You had a perm back then.
Major Monogram," Stay off the Internet, Carl."
Candace, (grunting; takes out Perry from tub) Here's cuteness!
Jeremy, (holds out towel; water drips off of Perry) That little guy's just drowning in mother love.
Doofenshmirtz," What's the matter, Perry the Platypus? Don't they feed you at the agency?"
Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, resting now. Resting."
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, you wanna go public? Fine."
Jeremy," Wow, Candace, you sure know your pet."
Jeremy,You're the most responsible pet owner I've ever seen.
Candace," That's me. Now that we're here, can I offer you a... (opens back door)"
Jeremy," A fun house? Man, your brothers are cool."
Candace," Oh, yeah. I'm sure."
Phineas," That was some fun, huh, Candace?"
Candace," No, not fun! Not fun."
Linda, (from outside the house) Candace? Boys? Come help me with the groceries.
Candace," I stand corrected. (leans out of her bedroom window) Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a giant fun house inside our house!"
Linda, I'll be right there. I just gotta get the groceries.
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, wait a minute. I've been going about this all wrong. I should be zapping you with the Least-Likely-inator so you'll lose! But first, I gotta get this sandwich out of the way."
Doofenshmirtz, Typical. (groans) I should've zapped myself.
Candace," But, Mom! Phineas and Ferb built a... (gets zapped by the ray) Urrgh!"
Candace, Why am I doing this?
Linda," So, where's this fun house?"
Phineas, Candace cleaned the whole thing up before you could see it.
Linda, You cleaned up the whole thing before I could see it?
Candace, Yes.
Linda," Well, that seems unlikely."
Ferb," Yes. Yes, it does."
"Major Monogram, Carl", Surprise!
Major Monogram, Congratulations! Astounding work.
Major Monogram,Your 100th battle with Dr. Doofenshmirtz...
Major Monogram,With five million downloads so far.
Major Monogram,"You're a star, Agent P."
