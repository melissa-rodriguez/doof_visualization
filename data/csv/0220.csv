Phineas," Now this is a ship. My, she's yar. Is she ready to sail?"
Ferb, She's shipshape in Bristol fashion.
Phineas, What does that mean?
Ferb," What does ""yar"" mean?"
Baljeet, Phineas! Ferb! I need your help!
Phineas," (As he and Ferb pulley themselves down to ground level) Hey, Baljeet. I thought your friend Mishti was visiting from India."
Baljeet, She is. But- she is different now.
Phineas, Different how? Did she turn into a werewolf or something?
Baljeet," No, she is- a girl!"
Phineas, She was probably a girl the whole time.
Baljeet," Let me explain. Four years ago, back in India, we used to have such a good time together."
Young Mishti, Give it to me!
Young Baljeet," No, no, no! Me! Give it to me!"
Young Mishti," No, me, me! (Baljeet shoves her out of the way. She promptly does the same thing to him.) I'm open!"
Phineas, And she never ever showed any kind of sign of werewolfism at all?
Baljeet," If we could just stick to the topic, please. Five minutes and forty-eight seconds ago, back in my home..."
Baljeet's mother, (offscreen) Baljeet! The Patels are here!
Baljeet, Coming! Misht-aah...!
Mishti," Hi, Baljeet!"
Baljeet," So after hiding in the bathroom, I jumped out the window and came over here as quickly as possible. I do not even know how to act in front of a girl! I do not even know what girls like."
Phineas," Hm. Isn't it like ""sugar and spice, and everything nice""?"
Baljeet, That is what they are made of. I do not want to build one. Duh!
Phineas," Y'know, I think what girls really like is romance."
Baljeet, Romance?
Phineas," Yeah, we learned all about it in this movie we watched last night. Dinner, music, candlelight, and all on a romantic cruise over the ocean blue. Lucky for you, we happen to have a ship right here. Ferb, cancel the giant bottle. I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry?"
Carl," Uh, you're gonna have to pick it up a little, sir. They're starting to boo."
Major Monogram," I've gotta hear, Carl. (A machine starts beeping nearby, signaling Perry's arrival) Oh, he's here!"
Carl," Well, not really sick, sir, I am a little concerned."
Major Monogram, (Overlapping him) What did I say about contradicting me in front of the agents?
Carl," Sorry, sir."
Major Monogram," So, that's pretty much it. You can go, Agent P."
Major Monogram," That's it. Okay, Carl. (Sounds of rock band)"
Baljeet's Mother, Baljeet? Aren't you in the bathroom?
Baljeet, I climbed out the window.
Baljeet's Mother," Oh, I thought it was a..."
Baljeet," Mother, please! May I just speak to Mishti?"
Mishti," Hey, Baljeet. What's up?"
Baljeet, (Clears throat) Um... If you do not already have plans for this upcoming afternoon...
Mishti," Actually, I had plans with you."
Baljeet," Oh, okay! Well, if you are busy..."
Mishti," Oh, no, Baljeet! What did you have in mind?"
Baljeet," Well, some friends of mine have planned... (pulls out brochure and reads it to her) ""an all-inclusive luxury cruise around Danville Harbor""."
Mishti, A boat ride? Cool! I will go get my stuff.
Baljeet," (Still reading the brochure) ""Highlights of the evening will include a romantic candlelit dinner with-""... oh, she is gone."
Candace," I just wish Jeremy was more romantic. You know, like Romeo-and-Juliet romantic, but without all the dying."
Phineas," Ahoy, Candace!"
Candace," Yeah, Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back. (Pushes another number on speed dial)Hey, Mom."
Linda," (Wearing a salad bowl attached to a pipe on her head, an unknown whirring noise emanating from it) Candace, make it quick. I'm in the middle of something."
Candace, (leaning out her window to see the ship) Phineas and Ferb are leaving on a cruise ship- but I don't even know where they're going!
Linda, (As the whirring noise gets louder) I can hardly hear you. What's this about a ship? Are you at the harbor?
Candace," No, I'm at home! Wait, the harbor! That's where they're going! I'll bust them there."
Lawrence," (As he stops blowing into the pipe attached to the salad bowl on Linda's head, revealing him as the source of the whirring noise) Was that Candace on the phone?"
Linda, Yeah. She probably doesn't know we're in the living room.
Lawrence," So, what do you think? (Starts blowing into the pipe again)"
Linda," (After a beat) You know, you're right. It does kind of sound like the ocean."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus. You like my scale model? (Gestures to a cardboard model he has made of Danville) I even put my own little building in there, look. Look, there it is! (points at the building) Ah, yes, my home. I can still remember the day I bought it. Flashback!"
Doofenshmirtz,"So, what I am going to do is move the light house all the way over here, to the other side of town! (moves his cardboard lighthouse to the other side of the scale model) The boats will follow it, like moths following a...have I already used that, uh...that metaphor? I think I...oh, how about bees going to...whatever bees go to, or flies to...oh, let's just go with the moth thing."
Baljeet," For your safety, Mishti, I invite you to hold on to the rail. It appears to be very clean, which I know is important to you now that you are a girl."
Mishti, Huh?
Phineas," (Waving) Hey, Isabella. What'cha doooin'?"
Isabella, The Fireside Girls and I just got our Shrimp Net Repair Patches. What are you doing?
Phineas, A romantic cruise. You wanna come?
Isabella, (Gasps in delight) You want me to come on a romantic cruise with you?!
Phineas," (oblivious) Yeah, it'll be fun."
Isabella, (a little nervously) Um...okay.
Candace," I knew it! Time to call Mom. (Dials her phone, then tries to yell into it, but a seagull squawks at the same time, scaring her)"
Linda, (As another unknown whirring noise is occurring in the background) Candace? I can't understand a word you're saying.
Linda," Candace, if you're feeding the geese again, I hope you're not wearing a tube top. (Hangs up, then looks at her husband, who is once again the source of the whirring noise) Do you mind?"
Lawrence, Now it sounds like a spaceship.
Linda," Okay, let me try."
Candace," Well, they've gotta come back sometime, and when they do, I'll be standing right here ready to bust them. (Three seagulls land on her head and shoulders, imitating her on the lookout. She shakes her arms to shoo them away) Would you get off of me?"
Isabella," (romatically) Wow, Phineas! This is so romantic!"
Phineas," (oblivious) You think this is romantic? Wait 'til you see what else I have planned. (Isabella blushes, and he takes her hand. He leads her inside the ship.)"
Isabella, (At the camera) Yes!
Phineas, Behold: a romantic candlelit dinner for two.
Isabella," Oh, Phineas!"
Phineas," Ferb, show the happy couple to their table."
Baljeet," Here is our table, Mishti. Is this okay with you? It is not too drafty, is it?"
Mishti," It will be fine, Baljeet."
Phineas, Cue music! (At Isabella) Classical music. Very romantic.
Phineas, Cue rose petals!
Phineas, Cue...'pid!
Buford," Hey, everyone. I'm wearing a diaper."
Phineas," (At Isabella, who is obviously not buying it) So...do I know romance, or what?"
Isabella, (Completely deadpan) What.
Phineas," (Oblivious) I said, do I know romance, or --"
Isabella, I heard you.
Baljeet," This food is really good, do you not think so?"
Mishti," Uh, yes...I guess so."
Baljeet," Subtle, yet pungent."
Mishti," Yes, very."
Buford," (Still hanging on the rope above the table) Hey, can you pass me one of those bad boys?"
Mishti," Uh...look, Baljeet, I appreciate all this, but, uh...I just want to hang out, like we used to."
Baljeet," But, uh, are you sure you do not want to hear more music?"
Buford," Did somebody say music? (Begins to sing) Ohhh-- (The rope snaps and he falls, crushing the table)"
Doofenshmirtz," I've attached rockets to the lighthouse, so when I push this button, it will fly to the other side of town, the ships will follow, and then I can finally get some sleep!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I suppose I should've put some sort of steering mechanism on it, but, um, live and learn."
Doofenshmirtz, Perry the Platypus? How did you escape?
Doofenshmirtz," (As he bends down) What's that? (Perry punches him in the nose) Ooh! I guess I walked into that one. (He falls backwards, right onto his scale model of Danville, destroying it) Aw, man, I worked all weekend on that! (Flashback of him gluing the buildings to the table)"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, look, this staple makes a perfect little chimney. I hope Perry the Platypus appreciates all this hard work."
Vanessa, (As she walks by in the background) He won't.
Doofenshmirtz, I know!
Doofenshmirtz," You know what, Perry the Platypus? I think it's time for you to go."
Doofenshmirtz," That's right, go on! Your services are no longer required. The lighthouse is gone, and there's nothing you can do about it. So you might as well run back to Major Monogram and tell him you lost this one."
Baljeet, Did I... Mention how nice the weather is?
Mishti, (Sighs) Several times.
Baljeet, Well... It is nice.
Phineas," I don't get it. We've tried everything in that romantic movie but nothing seems to work. The orchestra, the petals, the love song. The only other thing they did in that movie is sink the ship."
Phineas, That ought to do it.
Baljeet," I must apologize, the ship sinking was not in the brochure."
Phineas, Wow. Is this romance or what?
Isabella," Phineas, where are the life preservers?"
Phineas, We don't have any!
Isabella, What?!
Phineas," We've got ""Fun Preservers""! Hit it, Ferb."
Buford," Well, that's the end of this diaper."
Phineas," Okay, everybody, to the Fun Preservers!"
Buford," Oh, oh! Cupids first!"
Baljeet," So you are telling me that even though you are now a girl, you still like to have fun just like in the old days?"
Mishti," Of course, Baljeet."
Baljeet, Then you would not mind if I went like...this? (splashes water on her face)
Mishti, Not if you do not mind if I go like...this! (shoves him off of the Fun Preserver)
Phineas," Hey, this romance stuff was fun. We should do it more often."
Isabella," Yes. Yes, we should."
Phineas," Hey, there you are, Perry."
Candace," All right, you guys better tell me what you were up to on that cruise ship."
Phineas," Just whipping up a little romance for Baljeet and his friend, Mishti."
Candace, You created romance?
Phineas, Yeah.
Candace, And...did it work?
Phineas, Looks like it. They seem to be having a great time.
Candace, Do you think you could do that for me and Jeremy?
Phineas, I don't see why not.
Jeremy," Candace, I love having some kid's feet in my face as much as the next guy. But how about we just go grab a Slushy Burger?"
