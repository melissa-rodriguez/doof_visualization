"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh"," Uh, uh, can -- can -- excuse me, can you do it faster?"
Jim Cummings, What? What? (The crawl stops.) Faster?
Dan Povenmire," Yeah, and funnier, if possible."
Jim Cummings," Oh, faster? Okay. (The crawl reverses.) Um...all right, uh... (inhales)"
Jim Cummings," (faster, talking like the Tasmanian Devil) Episode IVa: ""May The Ferb Be With You"". On the Desert planet of Tatooine..."
Dan and Swampy," Uhm uh, yeah, yeah, no, no."
Jim Cummings, (normal voice) What? What?
"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh", Forget the funnier.
Dan Povenmire," Yeah, just go faster."
Jim Cummings, All right...
Jim Cummings," Episode IVa: ""May The Ferb Be With You"". On the Desert planet of Tatooine lived two happy young moisture farmers, who had absolutely no plans of leaving or getting involved in any kind of intergalactic shenanigans. Unbeknownst to them the Galactic Empire had recently finished constructing its ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR. Bum-bum-bum!"
"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh", (laughs) Sounds creepy like that.
Dan Povenmire," That's good, I like it."
Jim Cummings," Thanks. Yeah, it was capitalized. (reading) Meanwhile, having learned the whereabouts of the Death Star's plans, the rebels send their best platypus agent to obtain them, in hopes of finding a weakness. And none of this is canon, so just relax."

Phineas," Hey, Luke!"
Luke," Phineas! Ferb! What's up, guys?"
Phineas, Ferb? (Ferb pushes a button) Check this out!
Luke, Pod-racing engines? How'd you hook these up?
Phineas, We just picked up some power convertors at Tosche Station.
Luke, Nice!
Phineas, You need help with your moisture vaporator? We can trick it out like ours.
Luke," I wish, but Uncle Owen wants to do things the old-fashioned way. Even the droids he buys are used."
Phineas," Hey, Treadwell!"
Treadwell, (beeps)
Phineas," Well, we'll catch you later, Luke! We're gonna mosey on home for lunch."
Luke," Wow, when they mosey, they mosey! What in... (Looks up and takes out binoculars.) Is that a Star Destroyer?"
Candace, Finally some real Rebel-busting! (takes off helmet) This is why I joined the Empire in the first place.
Baljeet," I am so excited, I can hardly contain myself!"
Buford, I toldja ta go before the raid!
Baljeet, That is not what I meant! But now that you mention it...
Candace," Alright, lock it up! We've got Rebels to bust!"
C.O.," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going?"
Candace," Uh, space battle over that way?"
C.O., Certainly not. You know your mission: to find socks for Lord Vader.
Candace," Yes, sir."
Candace, SOCKS?!? This is a total waste of my potential! (frustrated grunt)
Buford, Not me. This is about where I peak.
Leia," Agent P, I need you to make sure this R2 unit goes to Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. But first, I need to record a video message. Be a dear and stand over by the bulkhead. You're kinda in my shot. (Perry walks away.)"
Buford, So what color socks do you think think he wants?
Baljeet," Uh, black?"
Buford," I'm just sayin', ev'rything the guy owns is black! You think maybe... (Candace signals for them to stop) What? (Cut to Leia putting the disc in R2-D2) Oh, there's somebody doin' somethin' over there."
Candace," Oh, yeah! It's busting time! (runs off, singsongy) Oh, Commander!"
Baljeet," Huh, we are never gonna get those socks, are we?"
Buford," Hey, I found a pair of socks."
Baljeet, Where?
Buford, Right here! (punches Baljeet)
Baljeet, Ow!
Buford," Don't be a baby, you're wearin' armor!"
Baljeet, But it is plastic.
Candace," Commander, Commander, there's a Rebel in a dress recording something into a droid!"
C.O.," Ooh! By chance, was this droid distributing socks of any kind?"
Candace, Well...no.
C.O., Then it's none of your concern. Is it? Back on sock detail!
Candace, (growls)
Buford, Me? I'm an argyle man.
Baljeet," Huh, I would not think that from looking at you."
Candace, Hey! Where'd they go?!
Buford," Danish Head ran off, but the droids are over there. (His blaster accidentally goes off.) Whoopsie!"
C-3PO," Oh, no!"
R2-D2, (beeps)
C-3PO, I'm going to regret this.
Imperial Officer 2, There goes another one.
Imperial Officer 3, Hold your fire. There's no life forms. It must have short-circuited.
Imperial Officer 2, (yawns and stretches) Coffee?
Imperial Officer 3, Yeah! Let's get some of that Sith Roast.
Candace," (offscreen) They got away! (The Stormtroopers run in.) We've got to follow them! C'mon, we'll take the other escape pod!"
Baljeet," Um, Candace?"
Candace, What?
Baljeet," (to the tune of ""The Imperial March"") ♪ Socks, socks, socks, socks so-socks, socks, so-socks! ♪"
Candace," Look, if we catch those two droids, we'll be promoted off of sock detail. Let's drift!"
Baljeet," Technically, we will not be drifting. More like violent ejection, plummeting through the atmosphere and crashing onto the planet's surface."
Imperial Officer 3," Mmmm, that's good coffee. Did you know this was decaf?"
Imperial Officer 2," Huh, I could not tell."
R2-D2, (screams offscreen)
Darthenshmirtz," How do you like that, Norm? My beautiful invention floating out here in space and do you think I get any credit for it?"
Norm-3PO," Your invention, sir?"
Darthenshmirtz," Well, yeah. I designed it to be a nutcracker. Here, l-l-look. Look at this. (He uses a model Death Star to crack a nut with a laser and eats it.) See? It works just fine. But the Empire took my idea and made it so big, it's completely impractical! A-A walnut would be totally obliterated!"
Norm-3PO, The universe is cruel and unjust.
Darthenshmirtz," Well, when they see my new invention, they'll be singin' a diff'rent tune! All I need is to get my hands on a little bit of Force to get it up and running. But where am I gonna find some extra Force?"
Norm-3PO, The Force surrounds us. It penetrates us. It binds the galaxy—
Darthenshmirtz," Yes, yes, I've seen the bumper sticker."
Darthenshmirtz,Act 2
C-3PO, No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
Candace," Ugh! Tatooine. Okay, my busting instincts are telling me that the droids went (points ahead) that way. Now, come on!"
Baljeet," Actually, I joined the Empire by accident. I was trying to sign up for a physics camp."
Buford," Physics camp? Yeah, you're better off. Hey, Candace, why did you join the Empire?"
Candace," Don't you remember anything from orientation? Rebels are cruel, heartless sub-humans who are messing up the galaxy! And I am all about law and order."

Candace," Well, we followed some droids that were ejected from the—"
C.O., Hup-bup-bup-bup-bup! The droids and the missing Death Star plans are none of your concern.
Candace, Death Star plans?
C.O., Never you mind! You go to Mos Eisley! I'm sure you can find some socks for Lord Vader there.
Candace," (disappointingly) Yes, sir."
Stormtrooper 5," Look sir, a magic flute!"

Phineas," Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!"
Lawrence," Hello, boys! You're just in time for lunch."
Linda," So, what's on the list? Another day filled with big plans? (reads the list) ""Herd all the nerfs into Beggar's Canyon, teach the sarlaac to brush his teeth, and giving a bantha a shower."" That's awfully ambitious!"
Phineas," Just tryin' to make the most of each and every summer day! Hey, we stopped by and saw Luke."
Lawrence," Ooh, let me guess, was he staring wistfully at the horizon?"
Linda, Lawrence?
Lawrence," What? Everyone knows that boy would rather be somewhere else. What about you two? The crops are so far ahead, would you like to spend the rest of the summer at swim camp on Naboo?"
Phineas," Sounds fun, but we'll pass."
Linda," Well, how about ski camp on Hoth? Don't you boys ever want to see the rest of the galaxy?"
Phineas," Not really. We've got everything we want right here on Tatooine. Sand, womp rats, brothers, and banthas. Why would anyone want to leave?"
Lawrence, Wait'll they see there's no girls on this planet!
Linda, Lawrence!
Uncle Owen," (offscreen) Take these two over to the garage, will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner."
Luke, But I was going in to Tosche Station to pick up some power convertors.
Uncle Owen," You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on, get to it."
Luke," Well, come on, Red, let's go!"
Luke, Uncle Owen?
Uncle Owen, Yeah?
Luke," This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!"
Uncle Owen," Hey, whatta ya tryin' to push on us?!"
Luke, (offscreen) What about that one?
Uncle Owen, (offscreen) What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
R2-D2, (beeps)
Luke," Okay, let's go."
C-3PO, Now don't you forget this. Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
Darthenshmirtz," Norm, bring all my gear down to my lair."
Norm-3PO, You mean the abandoned recycling compartment?
Darthenshmirtz, It's a lair!
Darthenshmirtz," Ooh, whadaya know? A moving sidewalk. (Darth Vader walks by.) Oh, ooh, Darth Vader! Hey, I know that guy! It's Darth Vader. Hey! (runs up to him) Hey, w-wait up, wait up! (knocks over a droid) Phew! Darth Vader! Hey look! Eh, I'm Darthenshmirtz! (trips) I'm not sure if you remember me, the Doof Star, the little nutcracker thing. And then you sorta stole my plans. (trips again) Anyway, I gotta new invention, and it's gonna knock your socks off! (trips again) I'm wondering if you could, uh, spare a little Force. I thought maybe you had a little extra lying around— (Bumps into a couple of Stormtroopers) Okay, uh, good talk."
C-3PO," (offscreen) Please, Master Luke took off your restraining bolt, now quit complaining. (Cut to inside.) Now I'm taking another oil bath. And I don't want to be disturbed. (goes down an elevator platform) Ahhh."
Phineas," Wow, that bantha took a while longer to clean than I thought it would. Well, we better get home."
Phineas, Whoa!
R2-D2, (beeps)
Phineas," Whoa, little fella. Sorry about that. Say, what's a droid like you doing out here in the Jundland Wastes?"
R2-D2, (beeps)
Phineas," Oh, cool! A movie."
Leia hologram," Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."
Phineas," Oh, she must mean Ben Kenobi. Hey, we were just there! We have Jedi lessons with him every Tuesday. He lives right up at the edge of the Dune Sea. Do you want a ride?"
R2-D2, (beeps no)
Phineas," Okay, suit yourself. (R2 leaves) And remember, sand people hide single file to hide their numbers. (to Ferb) Oh, he probably already knows."

Tusken Raider,Act 3
Tusken Raiders, (cheer)
Major Hologram," Ah, Agent P, our sources tell us that the R2 unit is safely in the possession of Obi-Wan Kenobi. You always come through for us. (Perry smiles nervously knowing that this isn't the case.) Great work! Now to take a well-deserved rest. (Hologram disappears. Agent P smiles and takes out a hanky to dry his sweat when his communicator activates again.) Agent P, I've got your next mission. You need to get to the Death Star immediately. Darthenshmirtz is working on a new inator. We need you to stop him before he can finish building it. Good luck."
Phineas," Okay, Mom! See ya later!"
Linda, (offscreen) Don't forget your two-sun sunscreen.
Phineas," Way ahead of ya, Mom! Hey, what's this? ""Death Star plans""? Wait, I bet it belongs to that R2 unit that we sent to Ben Kenobi's house. I wonder if he's still there."
Ferb, No. He is on his way to Mos Eisley.
Phineas," Oh, wow! Can you sense that with the Force?"
Ferb," No, I can see them. They're right over there."
Phineas," (offscreen) You're right, Ferb. And Luke's with them! Inside a—"

Ferb, (speaks Tusken and plays with the puppet)
Blatto, Phineas and Ferb! My best customers!
Phineas," Hey, Blatto, we're trying to find an R2 unit and give him back this data disc. (Blatto takes the disc.) Hey!"
Blatto, Let's take a look at it. (He puts it into an R2 unit's head and it shows a hologram of the Death Star.)
Phineas," Wow! It's an Imperial battle station the size of a moon! And according to these schematics, it seems to be designed specifically to destroy entire planets! Whoa, I-I never imagined the Empire would go that far! (Ferb points) Huh, you're right, Ferb. One proton torpedo in that small exhaust port and the whole thing goes blammo!"
Blatto," Uh, it's like it's got a self-destruct button. What kind of idiot would design that?"
Darthenshmirtz," Oh, why can't I master this?"
Phineas," Wait, if the Rebels have this information, they might stand a chance against this thing. A small one-man fighter could penetrate the outer defense, fly along that trench, and get to the exhaust port."
Blatto," Hey, spoiler alert!!"
Phineas, That droid must be part of the Rebel Alliance! We've gotta get this disc back to him!
Baljeet," Candace, did you get the socks?"
Candace, Mission accomplished.
Buford, I gotta hoagie!
Baljeet, Are those the stolen Death Star plans we are not supposed to be looking for?
Candace," I don't believe it! (to Phineas and Ferb) Hey, you with the Death Star plans, you guys are so busted!"
Phineas, Uh-oh! Let's get outta here!
Buford, And they're lost in the crowd.
Candace, Not on my watch! Let's go!
Phineas," Hey, look! There's the droid!"
Candace," You two, stop right there! (Buford fires his blaster again) Buford!"
Buford," Sorry, my bad!"
Random Guy, (offscreen) My watermelon!
Phineas, There's the droid! Let's get over there!
Stormtrooper 5, Stop that ship! Blast 'im!
Han," Chewie, get us outta here!"
Chewbacca, (roars)
Phineas, Maybe we came at a bad time.
Stormtrooper 6," Oh, crud, this is going to mean nothing but paperwork."
Phineas," If we don't get these plans to that R2 droid, entire planets could be destroyed. C'mon, we gotta find a pilot and follow that ship."
Cantina MC," (offscreen) Alright, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes! (Cut to inside the cantina where the band is leaving) Not a bad set, guys. Only one death and one dismemberment. Not bad for a Wednesday."
Ponda Baba, (speaks Aqualish)
Cornelius Evazan, I don't like him either.
Cantina MC," (offscreen) Alright, let's give 'er a big cantina welcome, folks, Vanessa the Twi'lek."
Phineas," (to the bartender) Um, we're looking for a pilot."
Bartender, Over there.
Nurse," Someone said he shot first, but I coulda sworn it was the other guy."
Bartender, Nope. There.

Isabella, For a price.

Phineas, Why'd you call it the Chihuahua?
Isabella, It's personal.
Phineas, Seems weird you'd call it something you didn't wanna be asked about.
Isabella, You're right. It was a call for attention.
Candace, There they are! (She blasts at them and hits a light.)
Phineas," Whoa! Well, looks like we got it!"
Isabella, (pulls the two brothers onto the ship) Move it! We gotta get outta here!

Phineas," Oh, that makes much more sense. Mom and Dad always did want us to see the galaxy, but I don't think that this is what they had in mind."
Isabella, You might want to buckle up. I'm makin' the jump to hyperspace!
Phineas, A little more warning would be nice.
C.O.," Ahem. I grow tired of asking this but, please, tell me you have the socks."
Candace," Yes! Buford? (Buford gives it to her.) With my compliments, sir."
C.O.," Excellent, now report to the Death Star for re-assignment. I'll deliver these to Lord Vader myself."
Candace, Finally! Now we're gonna see some action!

Buford, What a piece of junk!
Darthenshmirtz," Wait, that's it! I solved my Force problem! I can extract it from Vader's garbage. It...It says right here, see? You can find anything on the Internet. Hey, check it out, Norm-3PO. According to this real estate website, my time share on Alderaan is worth, like, 10 times more than I paid for it six years ago! Oh, I knew the value would go up! It's just, it's such a peaceful place to.. (Alderaan gets destroyed by the Death Star in the background.) Wait, what? What's this? The value is totally dropping!! Zero?!?!"
Isabella," (angrily) Hey, whatcha doin'?!"

Baljeet," Uh, Candace?"
Candace, Yes?
Baljeet, I believe Buford requires your attention.

Buford, Thinking is always hard.
Candace," I know. Here's the thing. If we have Darth Vader's socks, what exactly did we give the commander?"
Buford, Uhhhhh....
Vader, I find your lack of socks disturbing.
Stormtrooper 6, Hello? Are you open yet?
Stormtrooper 7, Hope they have the old-fashioned. Those are my favorites.
Isabella, I can't believe that worked!
Phineas," I feel guilty, though. Maybe we should get them some donuts."
Isabella, WOULD YOU STAY FOCUSED?!
Phineas, Huh. Sorry.
Isabella," Okay, let's find Solo's ship and the droid, and then I'm outta here!"
Phineas," Well, they've landed in Docking Bay 327, and we're in Docking Bay 427. (looks at the map) That's not so bad. (Sees Ferb with his eyes closed and his hand out) What is it, Ferb? What's with the hand?"
Ferb, I feel something. A presence I have not felt since...
Phineas," Perry! (Perry runs into his arms for a hug) Hey, old buddy!"
Isabella, Who is this?
Phineas," This is Perry the Platypus. He used to be our pet until we found out he was secretly an agent for the Rebellion. We felt a little betrayed and hurt at first, but bygones be bygones. Now we're good, right?"
Perry, (Chatters and thumbs up)
Phineas," So you're probably on a mission right now, huh? (Perry thumbs up) Hey, so are we! (fist bumps Perry) Heh. Oh, uh, this is our pilot, Isabella."

Oh, sorry about the door. I...I put in a work order, but the guy's not gonna get down here 'til, like, Thursday. So, y'know. Ah, ah, look, Norm, you see? You put a big red ""X"" on the floor, people will stand there! (A trap door opens under Perry and he drops down and gets frozen in carbonite.) Human nature! Or, in this case, platypus nature."
Phineas," What's wrong, Ferb? (Once again, Ferb has his eyes closed and hand out.) You got your hand up again."
Ferb, (Opens his eyes and puts his hand down) Perry is in trouble.
Phineas, Oh no! We must go help him.
Ferb, No. You must go get that disc to the Rebels. We cannot risk our mission.
Phineas, Split up? Really?
Isabella, Just do what you need to do fast and meet us at the Falcon!
Phineas, May the Force be with you and all that stuff.
Phineas, Come on! We gotta find that droid!
Norm-3PO, (hanging up the trapped platypus) There. It's just like art!
Darthenshmirtz," Yeah, nothin' like a frozen platypus to tie a room together! Now, allow me to tell you why I created my latest inator."
Darthenshmirtz," ♪ You see, the Force with me is weak ♪"
Darthenshmirtz,Darth Vader can kiss my bantha!
Norm-3PO," (applauding) Very good, sir! That was better than rehearsal!"
Darthenshmirtz," Alright, stay close to your comlinks, ladies, and, if all goes well, I'll have a victory number in the fourth act. (to Perry) So, like I said, I'm going to make myself super-evil with my Sith-inator here, but first, I'm gonna shoot you just to make sure it's safe and, uh, y'know, I don't...die or fry myself and have to wear one of those masks like Vader, 'cuz that would not be a good look for me."
Darthenshmirtz," (offscreen) Eh, y'know, plus, if it works, you can join me on the Dark Side. We can be Sith buddies! Whadaya think? Huh? (activates the inator)"
Ferb, (yells in pain)
Darthenshmirtz," Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait...what...who let a kid in here?! Hey, buddy, you okay? (to Perry) Yeah, he's gonna have a headache, but with any luck, he's gonna be so evil when he gets on his feet. Oh, great, I-I-I used up all the Force on this guy. Hey, Norm, grab the trash can. We gotta go refuel. Wait right here, Perry the Rebelpus. We'll be right back to turn you to the Dark Side, too, and then you, me, and...this kid in the cloak, I guess, can be the Three Sith-keteers!"
Norm-3PO," Who can I be, sir?"
Darthenshmirtz," You can be the horse. C'mon, let's go. We gotta get some more of that super-Force-y-Vader trash. I know just where to look."
Darthenshmirtz,Act 5
Han, We're all right now...
Candace," TK-90210 reporting for duty, sir!"
Imperial Officer 5, Just a minute.
Han," Uh, how are you?"
Imperial Officer 6," Oh, tell him I'm doing great."
Imperial Officer 5, We're sending a squad in.
Han," Uh, negative, negative. We have a reactor leak here, now, uh, no. Uh, give us a few minutes to lock it down. Uh, large leak. Very dangerous."
Imperial Officer 5, Who is this? What's your operating number? (Han blasts the comlink and it short circuits.)
Imperial Officer 6," Aw, I was just getting into that conversation!"
Imperial Officer 5," All of you, directly go to Level Five, Detention Block AA-23!"
Buford, Yeah!! Get them!
Baljeet," Buford, wait!"
Candace," Finally, some real action!"
Imperial Officer 5, Ah-dadadadadda! I need you to stay here and guard this post!
Candace, But but but...
Imperial Officer 5, That's an order!
Candace," Oh, bantha droppings!"
Phineas," ...and no matter what, we always did everything together."
Isabella, Are you done?
Phineas, Yep.
Isabella, Good. Then let's get going!
Candace," Serious trooper. (takes mask off seriously, then puts it back on) Happy trooper! (takes helmet off and smiles, puts it back on) Enigmatic trooper. (takes helmet off and looks enigmatic, puts it back on) Sad trooper..."
Phineas," (offscreen) It's down here around this corner, and... Uh-oh!"
Candace," Hey, you're the ones with the stolen Death Star plans!"
Phineas, Run!
Candace," Hey, that's coming out of my salary!"
Han," (offscreen, sarcastically) This garbage chute is a really wonderful idea! What an incredible smell you've discovered!"
Darthenshmirtz," Come here, boy, come here, that's it. Come on. (The dianoga swims up to him) That's it. Now, now, whatta ya got for Papa there? Ooh, is that Darth Vader's inhaler? Nice! Now we're talkin'! And what's this? This looks like a perfectly good bantha-cheese hoagie. Well, it's not good anymore. It's been underwater. Wow! According to this, it's reeking with Dark Force! Vader must've touched it. Put it in here. What else have you got for me? (The dianoga takes Luke.) That's not trash, dummy, that's a guy! Just put him back, I've got enough. Man, you can lead a dianoga to garbage but you can't make him think."
Darthenshmirtz, Uh-uh-uh! Don't forget to flush!
Luke, (offscreen) The walls are moving!
Leia, (offscreen) Don't just stand there! Try and brace it with something!
Darthenshmirtz," Man, someone needs to oil that thing."
Chewbacca, (growls offscreen)
Darthenshmirtz," Okay, come on, Norm-3PO, let's go make some Sith happen."
Darthenshmirtz," Oh, hey, they fixed the door! Must've been a cancellation somewhere. I'm gonna go check on the Sith-inator. You go see if that kid's evil yet."
Norm-3PO, Where did we leave him? Behind this box? (Perry emerges from behind the box with a blaster. He blasts Norm-3PO and he screams like R2-D2.)
Darthenshmirtz," Norm, what the heck are you standing around for? I thought I told you... Whoa whoa whoa whoa!! (Norm-3PO falls down on Darthenshmirtz. He groans.) Oh, my spleen."
Darthenshmirtz," Hey, get away from that! Perry the Rebelpus, you stay away from my inator! Don't make me— (Perry pulls down on Darthenshmirtz's jaw and throws him out.) No wait! Wait wait! Whooo!!! (Perry pounces on him.)"
Imperial Officer 7," You know, I'm thinking about getting a saxophone."
Imperial Officer Wayne," Huh, good for you."
Darthenshmirtz, (To Perry) I'd like to see you try that again! (Perry does)
Imperial Officer 7," Uh, should we report that?"
Imperial Officer Wayne, I'm not losing my place in line.
Candace," Hey, get back here, you two!"
Candace," Aaaaaah! (grunts, as Luke and Leia swing from a rope in the background) Help! Help! Help me! I'm slipping!! (grunts)"
Phineas, Oh no! I-I have to help her!
Isabella, Don't be a fool!
Candace, (grunts) (she whimpers as she is about to fall to her death until Phineas catches her by the hand) Aaah!
Phineas, I got you! (pulls her up)
Candace," Uh, but..."
Phineas, (gasps)
Candace, Why would you save me? You're a Rebel.
Phineas, You were in trouble. I couldn't just leave ya hanging...literally.
Candace, Well... (a blaster goes off) Buford! Watch where you're shooting that thing!
Buford, Seriously! Why don't they put safeties on these blasters?
Buford," Sorry, my bad!"
Stormtrooper 8," Hey, don't worry about it! I'm planning on hitting the wall and sliding down until I catch onto a radio antenna! Oh no! Wait, that's Cloud City I'm thinking of! (he crashes through to space) Oh, crud!"
Candace, But why would he save me?
Isabella," You're either really brave or really stupid! Well, kid, looks like your luck hasn't run out yet."
Phineas, There's the Falcon and the R2 unit! (They run down the stairs. Cut to the Docking Bay as Stormtroopers blast them.) It's getting away! But I've gotta get the disc to...
Isabella, Quick! Back to my ship!
Phineas," Wait, what about Ferb? We can't leave without him."
Isabella," If we don't leave now, we'll lose the Falcon."
Phineas, But I can't leave my brother.
Isabella," (indignantly) Tick-tock, tick-tock!"
Phineas," Isabella, you've gotta take the disc back to R2. I'll go find Ferb."
Isabella," If I leave, I am not coming back!"
Phineas, Fine. Just make sure you deliver the disc to the R2 unit.
Isabella, How do you know I won't just go back to Tatooine?
Phineas, (running off) I trust you!
Isabella," Remember that ""brave or stupid"" thing? I know which one it is!"
Phineas, What is that? It looks like it was built by... (A cloaked figure drops down. Phineas knows who it could be.) Ferb?
Phineas, Cool face paint!
Phineas,Act 6
Rebel Officer 1, Oh no!
Rebel Officer 2, What?
Rebel Officer 1, The disc is gone! The one with the thing for blowing up the Death Star!
Rebel Officer 2, Are you kidding me?
Rebel Officer 1, It's supposed to be right here!
Rebel Officer 2, This is not happening! No no no! We are so dead!
Rebel Officer 1," Is it right there? Is it on the floor? Maybe it fell out of the flight deck. Okay. Okay, I know. We'll blame Jar Jar."
R2-D2, (beeps)
Rebel Officer 2," Jar Jar Bi— That's a terrible idea! He retired, like, 20 years ago!"
Rebel Officer 1," Hey, it's not like we have a lot of options here."
Rebel Officer 2," Okay, let's do this. You go get a thermal detonator, and we'll put it right back here on the..."
Rebel Officer 1, NO! How is that better than my Jar Jar idea?
Isabella," Yo, tech support. Got something for ya."
Rebel Officer 2, (takes the disc) Oh my gosh! Thank you!
Rebel Officer 1," Yes, thank you! You saved our lives! (chuckles) Whoa, that was a close one, huh? Hey, where do you think she found it?"
Rebel Officer 2," Hey, man, never look a gift tauntaun in the oral cavity."
Darthenshmirtz," Hey, wait wait wait, I can't see! (Perry fights Darthenshmirtz.) Alright, someone's getting a lightsabering now! Oh, it's, uh, just a flashlight. I guess my lightsaber's in the camping supplies. (holds flashlight under his chin) Ooh, ooh, look, I'm scary—Uch, whatever. Bye! (he flees)"
Phineas, So is there like a face painting booth around here or something? And where's Perry? Were you able to find him?
Darth Ferb," I found this: the Sith-inator. And I've modified it to create an army of Sith warriors. Join me on the Dark Side, brother."
Phineas," (laughs) Shut up, Ferb! C'mon, let's get outta here. Isabella already left. We gotta find the ship so we can get home."
Darth Ferb, The Dark Side is my home now. (gets out a lightsaber)
Phineas," Whoa, Ferb, what are you doing? (Phineas tries everything to avoid his now evil brother.) Come on, quit messin' around! Hey, this-this isn't funny. I'm not gonna fight you."
Darth Ferb," If you will not join me, then I must destroy you."
Phineas," Okay, I can see you're serious. (Darth Ferb swings his lightsaber and Phineas dodges it.) Ferb, this isn't you! We're brothers!"
Phineas," Hey, this is crazy! We-We-We would never try to hurt each other! (Darth Ferb reveals he has a double-edged lightsaber. They continue to fight.) Is that the best you got? (Darth Ferb reveals he has more lightsabers now.) Oh, we're allowing modifications, huh? Gimme a sec. (He tinkers with his lightsaber.)"
Buford," Hey, Candace, what's up?"
Candace," Um, I was just thinking, we're the good guys, right?"
Baljeet," Yes, I believe so."
Buford, That's what they told us durin' the brainwashin'.
Baljeet," Orientation, Buford!"
Buford," Potato, tomato."
Candace, And Rebels are bad. We know that.
Baljeet, Of course. The Rebels are always the bad guys.
Buford, What about Robin Hood?
Baljeet, That has not happened yet!
Candace," Well, one of the Rebels just saved my life. He could've escaped, but, instead, he came back to help me."
Buford and Baljeet, Hmmmm...
Candace, And didn't we just blow up a planet?
Baljeet," Hmm, yes, that is sort of difficult to justify...morally."
Darthenshmirtz," (maniacal laughter) You're over there and I'm over here and never the twain shall meet. So I guess you're just gonna have to give up. (Perry takes a grappling hook out of his uniform.) Oh, I-I see, you're gonna swing across like a monkey-man. (pounds on his chest) Hoo-hoo-hoo! Me swingy-swingy monkey-man! Go ahead, knock yourself out. There's no way you got enough cable to reach that. (The grappling hook latches onto Darthenshmirtz's uniform.) Oh, I see what you were trying to— Yaaah! (Both Perry and Darthenshmirtz fall and get caught on another platform.) Ow! No no no! (They crash through a wall.)"
Isabella," Well, well, well, Han Solo."
PA Announcer," All flight crews, man your stations."
Gretchen," Hey, look! It's Isabella! Isabella, you've joined the Rebellion?"
Isabella, Not by a long shot.
Gretchen," Well, you should. You're a great pilot. We need you, the odds are stacked against us. The Empire has everything, a Death Star, highly-trained troops, Darth Vader. And we're just a ragtag bunch of undertrained good-intentioned Rebels. And to be perfectly honest, Isabella, we're kids. We are actual children, and they're letting us fly fighters. That's how hopeless the situation actually is. So, you wanna help us?"
Isabella," Strangely, still no. (She leaves them.)"
Porkins, (offscreen) Worst rallying speech ever!
Gretchen," Shut up, Porkins!"
Isabella," I'll have one of those. (she gets a juice box and some peanuts. Han and Chewie sit next to her.) What happened, Solo? Garbage scow tip over and dumped you here?"
Han," What are you doing here, Isabella? Did someone run out of cupcakes?"
Isabella, Very funny. So where are you heading?
Han, As far away from here as possible. (eats some peanuts)
Isabella, Yeah. I don't have any reason to stay here either.
Han, I don't owe anything to anybody. (eats some more nuts. Chewie looks at him.)
Isabella, I'm not in this to make friends.
Han, Yeah. Obviously.
Isabella, What do you mean by that? I've got friends! I've got plenty of friends!
Han, Yeah? Where are they now?
Isabella, Well...where are yours?
Chewbacca, (growls)
Han," Put a sock in it, fuzzball!"
Chewbacca, (whimpers and growls)
Han," (sighs) Maybe you're right. Maybe I do have someplace to be. See you around, Isabella."
Isabella," (sighs) Eh, the Wookiee is right. (she leaves)"
Darthenshmirtz, Ow.
Darthenshmirtz," Ah, it's good to be back. (Perry drops in) Hey! You're too late! No stopping me now! (He drops down into the trap door and gets frozen in carbonite.) Hey, it's cold in here! Ow! I've got such an ice cream headache!"
Darth Ferb, Now you will join me! (a blast shoots him and he groans)
Candace, Step away from the Rebel!
Phineas, Don't shoot him! He's my brother!
Candace, Your brother's a Sith warrior?!
Phineas," No. I mean, yes. I mean...it's a recent development. Wait, why are you helping me? I'm a Rebel!"
Candace, I had to. I couldn't just leave you hanging.
Darthenshmirtz," Hey, heads up!"
Darthenshmirtz," Hey, watch it!"
Candace," Hold it right there, pal! Aaah! (Darth Ferb attacks her more.)"
Darthenshmirtz," Hey, you're gonna stretch out the elastic."
Phineas, Ferb! Please stop!
Candace, Now I really wish I'd bought the three-pack!
Darthenshmirtz," Oh, man. I really should have ray-shielded that."
Phineas, (groans) Ferb? (Candace and Perry help him look under the rubble.)
Ferb, (groans)
Phineas, Are you okay?
Phineas, (hugs Ferb) Ferb!
Buford," Found this perfectly good robe lying around. Has one hole, right here. Hey, look what else I just found! My hoagie!"
Baljeet, I would not eat that if I were you.
Candace, C'mon! Let's get off this battle station.
Phineas, But we don't have a ship!
Candace, I know where there's a bus pod.
Phineas," Perry, great work! Hey, don't be a stranger!"
Darthenshmirtz, You think maybe you could turn this thing over? All the blood's rushing to my head.
Phineas," Hey, it's Luke! They must've got the plans! He should hit that exhaust port no problem. I mean it's as practically as big as a womp rat! (beat) Yeah, we should probably get outta here."
Candace, Come on! The bus pod is right through here!
Candace, Wait wait wait!
Buford, No no!
Baljeet, Oh no! That was the last ship!
Buford," Yeah, we're toast."
Phineas," Well, if we had to go out, at least it was for something we believe in."
Baljeet, My only regret is that I spent so much time on the wrong side.
Buford, My only regret is that I ate that hoagie.
Phineas," I guess if I have a regret, it's that I never got reunited with my sister. She left Tatooine when I was just a baby."
Candace, Phineas?
Phineas, Candace?
Candace," (hugs her brother) Oh, I can't believe it! You got so big!"
Phineas, Candace!
Candace," I didn't even recognize you! Hey, wait a minute, why is this guy hugging us?"
Phineas," Oh, this is Ferb. He's our stepbrother."
Candace, Mom remarried? What happened to Dad?
Phineas, (laughs) Funny story actually. He—
Phineas," Wow, that was close! Thanks for coming back to get us, Isabella."
Isabella," Well, that's what friends are for."
Baljeet," Oh, but what about all those innocent baristas and bank tellers and bowling alley attendants?"
Isabella, They're fine. The Firestar Girls got them out earlier.
Everyone onboard, We're okay!
Major Hologram," Ah, Agent P, with you stopping Darthenshmirtz, and the Rebellion destroying the Death Star, this day will be long remembered. Apparently, there are still copies of the Death Star plans out there so, we still might have a teeny problem there, but, heh, we'll blow up that battle station when we come to it. Hologram out!"
Darthenshmirtz," Ha ha! So long, Perry the Platypus! Now I can live to fight in the sequel! (He goes into an escape pod laughing.) Eh. I probably should have thought this one through better. I didn't realize the escape pod would be Platypus-sized. Plus, I'm sitting on my keys."
