Tour Guide," Let's continue our tour! Over here, we have the work of the great environmental installation artist Beppo Brown."
Django, That's my Dad!
Tour Guide," As Django can tell you, his father Beppo is famous for his monumentalist recreations of everyday objects."
Phineas," Wow, Django, it's so cool that your dad makes such huge things! Look at that giant toothbrush! And that giant dental floss. (Pans down) It's even been used. Whoa! And how about that giant baby?"
Django, My Dad didn't make that.
Linda," Django, isn't that your Dad over there?"
Django, Yeah! I'm gonna go say hi!
Beppo, You're taking it too literally. It's the juxtaposition of the doughnuts and the mountains that--
Django," Hey, Dad!"
Beppo," Hi, Django! How are you're friends enjoying the tour?"
Django, They love it! Wanna hang out with us?
Beppo," Uh, sorry, bud. But I gotta answer a few questions for these people and talk to them about my new project, but I promise I'll catch up with you just as soon as I can. Have fun!"
Tour Guide," Okay, folks. (Camera zooms out) Please take some time to look at Beppo's fabulous exhibit! Oh, and don't miss his newest addition, ""Doughnuts Over the Mountain"", which can be seen from the viewing platform."
Phineas, Cool! Let's check it out.
Linda," I'd like to see the giant mascara brush again. What do you say, Candace?"
Candace, Where's the giant exit sign? (Sighs) I'd rather be at home with Perry.
Linda, What do you suppose Perry does when we leave him at home?
Man," I love you, my darling."
Woman," No, I love you more than you love me."
Man, I hate you. (Hugs woman)
Major Monogram," Sorry to bother you on your day off, Agent P."
Woman, I love you!
Man, I thought you hated me!
Major Monogram," Agent P, you've got to concentrate. It's Doofenshmirtz again. He's expecting a visit from his old, evil science teacher, Dr. Gevaarlijk. You must get over there pronto. Those two together are a bad combination. Don't worry about your stories, we'll tape them for you."
Phineas," Wow! Your Dad's exhibit is really amazing! I can see where you get your artistic talent from, Django."
Django," Oh, I don't know, Phineas. I made this for my Dad, but it hardly compares to his stuff."
Phineas, This is a great painting! Your Dad would love this.
Django," But it's so small, and everything my Dad makes is so big."
Phineas," Why don't you just paint something bigger? Look out there, Django. Your father's display just happens to be right next to the Unpainted Desert. And that gives me an idea. (to Ferb) Ferb, we're gonna need some really big art supplies."
Django," Hey, we can use my Dad's old exhibit! He called it (Flips a light switch) ""Really Big Art Supplies""."
Doofenshmirtz," Dr. Gevaarlijk already? (Opens door) Oh, oh, it's just you, Perry the Platypus. I don't have much time today. You see, my old evil science professor is visiting, and we've always had a rather strained relationship. (Puts down a chair) I think it's best expressed through song. (Presses a button on a remote and the chair traps Perry) Tell me what you think, but no pressure."

Doofenshmirtz," So, now you know my plan. (Footsteps approaching) C-Can you hold on a second? I've got to go settle up with the dancers. (to Dancer) Okay, so you guys are all union, right? (Signs check and rips it out of checkbook) All right, here you go. And... Hey, you know, when I'm done with this thing, maybe you and I could, uh... (Dancer walks out of room) Uh, okay, okay. I'll call you! (At Perry) I think I got a shot there."
Django, So this is the famous Unpainted Desert.
Phineas, Not for long!
Django," Thanks, guys! I think I can show it to my Dad now."
Phineas, (Showing the finished painting) It's not finished until you sign it!
Django, You're right! We should all sign it.
Doofenshmirtz," (Gasps) My professor is here! (Laughs as he walks to the door) Now, Perry the Platypus, you will tremble before the mighty, (Opens door) Dr. Gevaarlijk!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk," Hello, Heinz. My, look how big you've gotten. (Walks off) Of course you still have that slouch."
Doofenshmirtz," Dr. Gevaarlijk, so good to see you."
Dr. Gevaarlijk," Oh, ja, I've come all the way from Gimmelshtump for chit-chat. So, show me what you're doing."
Doofenshmirtz," I am sure you will be most impressed with my latest evil inventions. (They walk into a room) Here, we have the Deflate-Inator."
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Hmm... Did it work?
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, well... No, not really, but I-- Here we have the Drill-Inator!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Did anyone get hurt with that?
Doofenshmirtz," Mmm... No, just-- Just me. (Chuckles) But, uh..."
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Did any of these actually work?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, (Laughs) No, not really. But follow me. (They walk to the kitchen) I do something impressive over... There. My brand-new... Blender-Inator! (Opens the lid and puts a Granny Smith apple in the Blender-Inator) Spelling doom for even the toughest of apples! (Turns it on) Bow down to me, Granny Smith!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk," Ja, I'm sure if I was a pomaceous fruit, I would be trembling. Where is your Phone-Inator? I need to call a Cab-Inator'."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, uh, it's, uh, just, uh... (Dr. Gevaarlijk walks away and he stops her) Wait, wait! Don't go. Let me show you this; my very own nemesis."
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Oh Heinz. How can he be your nemesis? (Camera zooms out showing Perry is his normal pet mode) He's doesn't even have a hat.
Doofenshmirtz," No no, I made that mistake a couple times, too, but that's him, I swear!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk," In your letters, you said your nemesis was a (Takes out a letter) suave, semi-aquatic personification of unstoppable dynamic fury."
Doofenshmirtz," He is! No, you've just got to see him in action. Here. I'll let him go. (Presses a button on a remote and the chair trap releases) Go ahead, (Puts the remote away in his coat) Perry the Platypus. Thwart my plans. Come on. (Crosses his arms) Let me have it! (Pause) Let me have it, big guy!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Heinz.
Doofenshmirtz, Get thwartin'!
Dr. Gevaarlijk," He's just a platypus. They don't do much, you know?"
Doofenshmirtz," No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! He's just about to do something. Wait for it!"
Doofenshmirtz, Hmm. I guess it's just a platypus. I could have sworn that was him.
Dr. Gevaarlijk," Heinz, this is just sad."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, one more thing. (Walks her to a different room) This is going to blow your socks off."
Candace," I know the boys must be around here somewhere. (Notices the viewing platform) Wow, what a view! Well, may as well see what this doughnut nonsense is all about. (Walks to the telescope and looks to it) Wow, it's actually pretty cool! (Moves the telescope to the Unpainted Desert) So this over there must be the Unpainted Des-- (Camera zooms out as Candace notices the painting) Hey, that doesn't look unpainted to me! (Zooms in on the painting autographs) PHINEAS AND FERB?!! (takes the telescope away from her eye and smiles) Oooooooooh....BUSTED!!!"
Django," Dad, Dad, Dad!"
Doofenshmirtz," Doctor, Doctor, Doctor! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. To honor your visit, I will blow up the moon!"
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Blow up the moon? But that would mean--
Doofenshmirtz, Yes! No more stupid songs about moons.
Dr. Gevaarlijk, (to the camera) I do despise moon-related songs. (to Doofenshmirtz) Continue.
Doofenshmirtz," It takes a lot of power, so I can only fire it once, but don't worry. (Leans on his ray) I have it planned down to the last-- (The ray is pushed downward. It fires a laser and it hits a dam. The water starts flowing from the dam) (While looking through binoculars) Oops! (Chuckles) No more songs about dams?"
Dr. Gevaarlijk," Oh, but I like a good toe-tapping dam song."
Candace," Mom, you've gotta see this! (Runs off)"
Linda," Well, at least she's excited about art."
Django," Dad, you've gotta see this! (Tries to tug him from the media group)"
Candace, (With her eyes closed) Take a look at that!
Linda, Wow!
Lawrence, Donuts over the mountain.
Candace," No, no, the other thing."
Linda," Oh, I see what you mean, Candace. The natural beauty of the Unpainted Desert is like a work of art!"
Candace," Mom, there is nothing natural about the-- (Turns her head and notices the painting disappeared) Huh? But...but...but..."
Phineas," Hey, Mom! Hey, Dad!"
Linda, There you boys are!
Django," Okay, Dad, this way! It's time for your big sur... prise? (Looks around for the painting and takes out the small picture) But, um...."
Beppo," Whatcha got there, Django?"
Django," Well, I made this for you, but (Beppo takes the picture) it's kinda small compared to what you do. It's not real art."
Beppo," It's beautiful, son. (Shakes his hair) You're a real artist."
Django, Really?
Beppo," With your permission, (Holds up the picture) there's a very special place I'd like to put this. Come on, bud."
Phineas, Wow. There's no higher place of honor than the fridge.
Ferb, Especially a giant fridge.
Doofenshmirtz," (Depressed) Oh, Dr. Gevaarlijk, today was supposed to be the day that I impressed you (Walks away) with the enormity of my evil schemes and finally earn your respect."
Dr. Gevaarlijk, Oh Heinz. Evil doesn't always have to be on a big scale. You can spread evil in the little things you do everyday.
Doofenshmirtz, (Touched) You're right.
Dr. Gevaarlijk," (Walks to Doof) But sadly, you can't even do that! You're a total failure! You sicken me, Heinz Doofenshmirtz! (Walks away) Gevaarlijk out! (Slams door)"
Doofenshmirtz," Wow. That could have gone better. (Perry walks up) Oh, there you are, Perry the Platypus. Oh, you... You saw that, huh? Yes. Of course. (Pause) You think I'm evil, right? (Perry smiles) Thank you, Perry the Platypus. (Camera pans to Perry and him looking at the moon) Thank you."
