,"Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house, while it's raining.)"
Buford,"Okay, I'll rephrase it. What kind of fun can we have when it's raining? "
Buford,(Punches Baljeet) How do you feel now? 
Baljeet,(Whimpers)In pain. 
Buford,"There, we're done. I guess that was fun. Off-Screen "
Voice,How about a game of hide and seek? 
Boy,I did! Phineas:Who are you? 
Boy,"Allow me to introduce myself. (Walks over to Phineas and Ferb)I'm Irving. I'm your biggest fan! (Chuckles) Phineas:How long have you been sitting there? [[6]]:A couple hours. My horoscope says I'm a background type. (Raises book entitled ""P & F"")Check it out. I've kept a scrapbook of your adventures. (Opens book to a picture of Phineas, Ferb and co. on the rollercoaster)This is the time you[that rollercoaster]. (Flips page to Phineas and Ferb on a Chariot at Paul Bunyan's Pancake Haus)And this is the time you[Lightning|built those chariots]. (Flips to picture of Phineas and Ferb in the kitchen with Irving in the background)And this is when you [Platypus|had that soup]. Baljeet:(Scoffs)Oh, what a nerd. Phineas:Is that a lock of Ferb's hair? Irving:(Snatches book back)Don't touch it. Phineas:Irving suggested hide and seek. Buford:Isn't the house a little too small to play a good game of hide and seek? [[7]]:Perhaps the problem is not that the house is too small, but that we are too big. Phineas:He's right! You kids hang tight while Ferb and I use the technology from our [to the Center of Candace|submarine adventure]to make a new shrinking machine. Ferb, I know what we're going to do today! (Irving squeals in excitement) Irving:(reverently)You said the words. Hey, can I say the Perry thing? Phineas:Wha? Irving:You know, when you say ""Where's Perry?"" Phineas:O...kay. Irving:Where's Perry? Ah, oh wait, wait, I can do better. Where's Perry? Where is Perry? Wherefore art thou Perry? I wonder where that Perry went. (Everyone starts backing away from him) Irving:Oh, where is that platypus? Where the P-man at?"
Phineas,"Alright gang, we can start that game of hide and seek now. (Ground shakes) Isabella:What's that? Baljeet:(Yells)Earthquake! Phineas:No, it's Candace. Hey, Candace is it! Everybody hide! [[8]]:(On the phone)Stacy, the bow is totally cute. It's your signature look. You have the bow, and I have (Pause)some weird metal contraption in the living room. (Runs up to it)Stace, I'll call you back. This thing was obviously made by Phineas and Ferb, so it must do something. Isabella:(Running with Phineas)Phineas, look, on the umbrella stand! Phineas:It's Baljeet! Baljeet:Oh no, she found me. I guess I'm it! (Screams as Candace opens the umbrella catapulting Baljeet to the ceiling, onto the lamp) Phineas and Isabella:Baljeet? Baljeet:I'm okay! (Door shuts as Candace leaves) Phineas:We gotta get that shrinker back! Irving:You guys always have a plan. Phineas:We don't have a plan. Irving:What? Phineas:We'll just have to wing it. Irving:There's no winging, there's no winging in the book. You guys have just been improvising this whole time? (Dramatically)Oh, how heroes fall! Baljeet:Hey guys! Remember me? Up here with the dead flies? Phineas:Sit tight, Baljeet! We'll have you down as soon as we can. Baljeet:How can I sit tight? With that air conditioner up there freezing me! (Teeth chattering)So cold. So cold."
Doofenshmirtz,"Activate bug eye-bot. (The bug eye-bot activates)Yes, my little robot eye, find Perry's address for me. That's right, walk towards the front door so I can see the number. Oh, it will be so delicious to know where Perry lives. I can ring his doorbell...and run away! (Laughs maniacally)(Cut to Candace running to the Garcia-Shapiro household, she knocks on the door)"
Candace,"(singsong)Hey Mom?! I want to show you something! (normal voice, looks back) Yep, I'm one step ahead of you boys, one step. What the heck is this thing!? (presses antenna, shrinks)'(Gasps)I'm shrunk! (Crashing noise as the shrinking machine falls next to her)Where's the reverse button?"
Isabella,"Phineas, we've got to get to that machine across the street. Irving:(Groaning)What's the point? We're vacuum bag filler. Buford:Thanks for that, Captain Bring-Down. (Group screams as Doofenshmirtz's bug descends upon them)"
Doofenshmirtz,"What? Some kiddie TV show? Agh, the signal must have gotten switched. (Presses buttons)Aw, and now I've lost the picture entirely. (Pause)Hm. I hope it doesn't go rogue."
Doofenshmirtz,"(Pounding his computer screen)Ohh. Work! Work! (Perry is awakened by the pounding noise coming from the robot eye, which is still lying on the floor where Buford tossed it, and slips his fedora on) ♪Perry! ♪ Doofenshmirtz:Come on. Ooh, hey, random pounding works. Oh good, we're back on the Perry show. (Perry holds the robot eye up to his own) Doofenshmirtz:Ahhh! All right, Perry the Platypus, could you just do me a favor and hold this up to the street address in front of- (Perry crushes the robot eye between his fingers, removes his fedora, and returns to sleep)"
Doofenshmirtz,"You think you're so clever, Perry the Platypus. But for the first time in my life I can actually use a self-destruct button that I have installed! Prepare to be vaporized, Perry the Platypus! (Doofenshmirtz presses the self-destruct button)"
Doofenshmirtz,"Well, that's done. And no comeuppance. (Pause. A sad violin plays in the background) Why do I feel so empty?"
