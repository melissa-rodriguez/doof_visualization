Phineas," (Wakes up, snoozes alarm clock) Another fantastic year older, and this is gonna be the best birthday ever! So, what are we gonna do, Ferb? (Camera pans to Ferb's bed, showing a card) Ferb? (Camera zooms in) Huh! A note! (Gets off his bed) ""For the celebration of your birthday, just follow these clues to show you the way"". Cool! It's like a birthday adventure. But hey, where's Ferb?"
Candace," (Talking on her cell phone) I can't believe it! It's Phineas's birthday, and I still don't know what to get him! What can you get for the boy who can make everything? (Sighs) It's my fault. I should have been thinking about this before, but I've just been so distracted by trying to bust Phineas and-- Wait! (Notices Ferb behind a tree; The garage door opens and Ferb runs into the garage) What is he up to? T-T-Y-L, Stacy!"
Isabella," Hey, Ferb! (Ferb takes off his fedora) We were just discussing our plans for Phineas' birthday. The circus we ordered won't be arriving 'til later in the day, (Irving walks up) but Irving had a great idea for a warm-up."
Irving, We should make a video compilation of all of Phineas' greatest moments!
Buford, What? Like on a clip show? (Crosses his arms) Lame.
Irving," Not where a genius like Phineas is concerned, watch this. (Turns on TV)"
Phineas," Okay, Ferb. Let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull. (Ferb presses a button on a controller)"
Phineas," (Explaining Candace her mission) After you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free-fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch."
Phineas," (In a video game) Wow, a castle! Nice art direction, Ferb."
Phineas," (Riding on a rocket attached to a bike with Ferb and Candace) Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh?"
Phineas," (Showing a giant paper-maché plane) Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes."
Phineas, (Showing Isabella a dining room) Behold! A romantic candlelit dinner for two.
Phineas, (Building a giant card house) We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat.
Phineas, (Showing a giant contraption) The Phineas-and-Ferb-edge-of-insanity-kiss-your-butt-goodbye-gravity's-a-stone-cold-sucker-nightmare-rail-skate-track-obstacle-course of doom!
Candace, Will you please tell me what's going on here?
Phineas, We're building an animation studio.
Phineas, (Exiting a giant bowling ball) That was amazing!
Phineas," (With Linda's tricked-out car) The flying car of the future, today, is still pulling a bit to the right."
Lawrence, A monster truck!
Phineas, Yeah! Isn't it sweet?
Phineas, (Revealing the rollercoaster) THE COOLEST... COASTER... EVER!
Irving, (Imitating fanfare. The camera zooms out as he imitates a kettle drum beat and turns off the TV)
Baljeet, Why did you not just use the kettle drum?
Irving," I never learned how to play. (Pushes the kettle drum away, and a cat yowls) Anyway, (Candace looks through the window and swoons) By utilizing my extensive collection of spy cameras, I've got footage of everything that Phineas has ever done. But I haven't had time to edit all of it-- Well, what, with-- You know, filming more. (He and Baljeet, Buford and Isabella walk to Ferb) I've divided up all the video into 3 parts. (Shows the CDs) Each of you take a section, (Isabella, Baljeet and Buford each takes a CD) Edit your tribute, and we'll meet at the party later."
Candace, (Giggles)
Phineas," (Runs to the kitchen) ""This birthday excursion will take you afar, you'll find your next clue where the 2x4s are"". 2x4s, huh? Perry, are you thinking what I'm-- (Camera pans to Perry's bed) Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," (To Carl) Okay, now let me to do the talking."
Major Monogram," Oh, Agent P! There's a something we need to discuss for a while, you see Perry's job and performances which come up, (Perry's face became surprised) but don't get me wrong, it's just like your entrances became ""lackluster"" lately. (Perry's face became sad) We just expect more from you. Roll the footage Carl!"
Carl, Right away sir.
Animatronic Animals, ♪ You're gonna get a mission ♪
Major Monogram," What happened to that guy? No pressure, but style counts. (Perry salutes and walks away sadly) Let's, uh, let's give him a few days, and then we should talk to him about his exits."
Candace," Hi-ya, Isabella."
Isabella," Oh hi Candace, what are you doing here? In my house?"
Candace," Oh just barging around. You know me, big barger. So, what is that?"
Isabella," Oh, just a little birthday video I'm editing for Phineas."
Candace, Then let's see.
Computer Phineas," (in the video, spliced together) We'll-Be-Together-Forever-Isabella."
Isabella, (Looks embarrassed at Candace) Hehe...
Candace," But... don't you have anything more, you know, unusual?"
Isabella, Of course! Watch this. (Presses play)
Isabella," (in video) I saw the best girls of my troop, hungry, patchless, out of uniform."
Candace," Okay, seriously, whoa. I mean, like Phineas's inventions?"
Isabella," Nope, I didn't get any of that footage."
Candace, Then you're useless to me. Candace out!
Isabella, (After Candace leaves) Hm... I'll have to talk to her about her exits.
Computer Phineas, (spliced again) Isabella-Will-You-Marry-Me?
Isabella, (dreamily) Ah... The magic of digital editing!
Doofenshmirtz," I see you, Perry the Platypus, now kick the door... (Perry kicks the door and the trap, a large TV, activates) Haha! Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! Hee hee hee! I saw you coming from my video surveillance system! Ah, if I had a nickel for every time I've trapped you."
Doofenshmirtz, Come here. (Perry steps forward and a cage falls on him) Ha-ha-ha!
Doofenshmirtz, Ha-ha-ha!
Doofenshmirtz, Ha-ha! Made you carry your own trap!
Doofenshmirtz," Huh, I thought it would be more than that. I guess I could get a candy bar or something. Anyway, I've been studying all my previous schemes and I figured out why they always seem to fail. Let's see if you can figure out what they all have in common. Look!"
Doofenshmirtz, Behold! The Mime-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, The Mountain-out-of-a-Molehill-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, The Aerosol-Propelled Ozone-Deplete-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, The Metal Destruct-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, Giant Dog Biscuit-inator. (dogs bark) Thank you! Thank you for making my point for me!

Doofenshmirtz, My Blow-Itself-Up-inator! (explodes)
Doofenshmirtz, The Monster-Truck-Away-inator.
Doofenshmirtz, The Atomic Leaf Blower-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, The Sandwich Suit Remove-inator!
Doofenshmirtz, I call it my Turn Everything Evil-inator.
Doofenshmirtz," See? They all have ""-inator"" in the name. That is why they fail. Which is why I named my latest creation, The Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-Inator! You see, I added ""non"" to the name, because ""non"" means ""not"", so it's a ""not-an-inator"", therefore, it can't not fail. Get it? I mean, it can't... can't fail, it... okay."
Candace," Heeheehee... (phone rings) Hi, Mom."
Linda," (on the phone) Where are you, Candace? You promised you'd help frost the cake after you got Phineas's present."
Candace," Yeah, well I got a little sidetracked preparing the bust of the century. Later today, I'm going to show you something you won't believe."
Linda, If I have a nickel for every time I've heard that.
Candace," Mom, you've got to see this."
Candace," Mom, they're driving a herd of cattle right through downtown."
Candace," See, Mom? There! Mom?"
Candace, Mom! Dad! Heeheeheehee. Look at what Phineas and Ferb did to the backyard!
Candace, See? It's a submarine!
Candace," (in Picasso's ""Guernica"") Mom! Mom! Mom!"
Candace," Come on, come on. You gotta see this."
Linda," Candace, will you--"
Candace," Mom, you gotta come home right away. Phineas and Ferb have... th-they build a... a thing that... that... oh, what's the use?"
Candace, Mom! Mom! Look at this! Look at me!
Candace, MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM!
Candace, Mom! Mom! Giant building!
Candace," Come on, come on, come on!"
Candace," Mom, you've gotta see this! It's about your car!"
Candace, Mom! Mom! Quick! Mom! Look! Before it disappears!
Linda, Now where's this giant animation studio?
Candace," It got up, and it danced away."
Linda, It what?
Candace," It got up, and it danced, away. (counter stops at $0.75)"
Linda, Hmm. I guess I can buy a candy bar.
Phineas, Tri-State Plank & Board. Some of our best structures were born here. (walks inside)
Worker, Phineas Flynn. Is that the birthday boy I hear?
Phineas, Yep. (removes helmet shaped like the top of his head) In the flesh.
Worker," Oh, you and your helmet."
Phineas, Have you seen Ferb today?
Worker," No, but I did see a guy in a robotic bird-themed super suit shooting eggs out of his wrist."
Phineas, (points his finger at her)
Worker," ...and that was Ferb, wasn't it?"
Phineas, It's a safe bet. We used a robotic bird-themed super suit to save City Hall this summer.
Worker, Aren't you a little young...
Phineas, (laughs) If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that.
Factory Manager, Aren't you a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?
Contractor, Aren't you a little young to be a landscape contractor?
J.B., Aren't you a bit young to be toy designers?
Ben Baxter, Aren't you a little young to be pop stars?
Charlene Doofenshmirtz, Aren't you a little young to be detectives?
Boat Captain, Aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel?
Officer, Aren't you a little young to be working in a museum?
Delivery Man 3, Aren't you a little young to order all this?
Delivery Man 2," Yes, yes he is. (to Phineas) Sorry, Phineas. He's new."
Delivery Guy, Aren't you kids a little young to be discovering Atlantis?
Danny, Aren't you a little young to be fans of Love Händel?
Charitable Charities Manager 3, Aren't you a little young to know about all these old detective shows?
Ranger, Aren't you boys a little young to be restoring a national monument?
Phineas, Yes. Yes we are. (counter stops at $0.60)
Worker, Was I supposed to see something just now?
Phineas," Nah, I was just thinking to myself. It's a clip show. So where'd you see Ferb?"
Worker, He was right over here. That suit really holds a lot of eggs.
Phineas, Huh. A visual clue!
Worker, Is that a Slushy Dawg on a stick?
Phineas," Yep, and a fine example of the lost art of egg-rendering."
Baljeet, Almost done.
Candace, (kicks the door open) You! Step away from the computer! I want to see that video.
Baljeet, But...
Candace, Play it!
Baljeet," Okay, okay!"
Candace," Phineas and Ferb, I've got you now! (Baljeet presses Play)"
Candace," (hallucinating, singing) ♪ Why do my nostrils whisper to me? ♪"

"Linda, Lawrence", Ki-ki-ki-ki-ki!
Ba-dink-a-dinks, We are the Ba-dink-a-dinks!
Candace, What the heck was that?
Baljeet," That is what I said! Sure, give the weird stuff to Baljeet! Who cares if it does not work out of context?"
Candace, Where's the rest?
Baljeet, This is all they gave me!
Candace," Ugh, that leaves Buford. (leaves)"
Baljeet, I need better clips.

Announcer," (Roger is seen chopping some wood and kissing a baby. He is also seen at the Tri-State Area costume ball in a superhero costume with a woman in a cat costume. Then, Roger jumps into the air a la Superman, while the woman looks up in surprise.) Culture. Square-jawed. Danville Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz. Profiled on: ""Younger Brothers of the Useless."""
Doofenshmirtz," It's a 12-part mini-series running all day long; nothing but propaganda. He can't really fly, they did that with wires. So that is why I invented the Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-inator; ""non""-inator, mind you, for reasons we've already discussed. With this, I will preempt the biography of my brother so he can't rely on that 14-karat smile and his freakish ability to not be despised. I mean, look at this city, look at all that urban blight that, uh... that isn't there anymore, and... and the public transportation, all... uh, clean and... efficient and... (sighs) running on time... Okay, let's just say I'm gonna let Roger warm up the room for me, then I'll preempt his ridiculous documentary with live video of me announcing my take-over of the Tri-State Area. (puts on Roger's glasses) And maybe I'll put on these glasses like he wears. (tosses them aside) I don't know. What am I, gonna throw away my best stuff on a clip show? Forget it. Now let's light this pop stand. Could take a while, though. It's gotta... it's gotta warm up... vacuum tube."
Candace, This is it. All I need to do is get Buford away from that computer and...
Biffany," (off-screen) Buford, honey, come over here!"
Buford," (off-screen) Coming, Mom!"
Candace," Ooh, lucky break. (climbs in through the window) Okay, let's see. (presses Play)"
Phineas," Howdy, Candace. Enjoying the rodeo?"
Phineas," Well, here's the foyer; all-imported marble, by the way..."
Phineas," You can stop laughing and pointing, because now it's time for... (his oversized pants fall down) Oops."

Candace, (screams)
Phineas," Hey look, a cloud angel!"
Phineas," ...terracotta army room, (shouting) jet engine wind tunnel..."
Phineas," ...and, scoring stage with 40-piece orchestra."
Buford, Buford's first!

Candace," I got it! Ha ha ha! Ah ha ha! (shouting to the entire street) Today, I will bust my brothers, and this time, I mean it!"
Man 1, I've heard that before!
Man 2, Every day the same thing.

Candace, You'll see! (car alarm goes off)
Phineas," Googolplex Mall, home of the original Slushy Dawg. Hey Jeremy!"
Jeremy, Want a Slushy Dawg?
Phineas, Sure. Supersuit-generated egg renderings always make me a bit peckish.
Jeremy," I bet that's the first time anybody's ever said that. By the way, (hands Phineas a folded piece of paper) Ferb left this clue for you."
Phineas, Thanks.
Jeremy, I bet you guys have heard a lot of strange sentences over the course of the summer. (hands Phineas a Slushy Dawg)
Phineas," Boy, I'll say. (takes a bite)"
Jeremy, Can you think of any examples?
Phineas," Nope, not offhand. See ya! (leaves)"
Jeremy, Happy birthday! (begins whistling while cleaning the counter)
Phineas, Wait a minute! (running back to the counter) I just remembered some!
Phineas, Nothing says mother's love like a giant robotic platypus butt.
Candace, Why am I wearing a turtle on my head?
Buford, I wanna float around! Like men.
Candace (in Perry's body), Am I sweating milk?
Future Candace," Gotta go, Stacy. Good luck with that llama legislation."
Man, Run for your lives! It's Gnome-ageddon!
Isabella, Stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses...
Buford, (rowing a boat past a lighthouse) I knew I should've gotten the down payment on the elephants.
Linda, It looks a little like a rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig.
Stacy," (as the Dangerbil) Ohh, no. You did not just tell me to hench."
Phineas," What, you think we should have more Bulgarian folk-related elements?"
Linda, I'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese.
Phineas," Dad, you might want to wipe the queen off your face."
Baljeet," I, too, feel a certain element of kabob-ism."
Ferb, Definitely the giant floating baby head.
Buford, I am to metaphor cheese as metaphor cheese is to transitive verb crackers.
Candace, I just discovered why cows and frogs don't date.
Phineas," ""Lawn gnome beach party of taffeta."" Make a note of that."
Candace," I'm calling Mom. (goes inside, slamming the door; promptly reopens it) And I am not using the banana this time!"
Phineas," Couldn't see any of that, though, could you?"
Jeremy, Not a bit.
Phineas," It's a clip show thing. (unfolds and reads clue) ""I hope you had fun on this scavenger hunt, now head back to the place where we plan all our stunts."" Home it is!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh yeah, we're gettin' there now! Soon I will preempt my brother's documentary marathon with my own live video! And there's not a thing you can do about it, like... li... like all those other times."
Doofenshmirtz, Now I can't make up my mind- (Perry punches Doof repeatedly in the face)
Doofenshmirtz, I can't believe you fell for that (pulls down a fake window) fake window trick. Ha-ha-ha... (Perry swings through the window and kicks Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz, How did you get out of that double knot?
Doofenshmirtz," (standing on top of Big Ben) Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey! (Perry appears behind him, kicks him off the tower, and catches his remote)"

Doofenshmirtz," ...it turns you visible ag...Aagh! Ow! Oh, well that came out of nowhere."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great. Now I have to make an Outside-In-inator."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, how did you escape? (Perry beckons Doofenshmirtz to come closer, then punches him in the face) What's that? Oh!"
Doofenshmirtz," (having been hit with the Age Accelerator-inator) Well, it's already 4:30; I think I'm going to bed. Curse you, Perry the Platypus."
Doofenshmirtz," I shouldn't dwell on it, i...it's just too painful. But I gotta stop living in the past."
Doofenshmirtz," What? Why did I put that button on the... Oh, I guess aesthetically, it ma... (Perry punches Doofenshmirtz, who flies across the room) Oof! You may have escaped my TV trap, Perry the Platypus, but I'm still going to change your channel! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! (Doofenshmirtz pulls a laser remote out of his lab coat and fires it at Perry. He misses and shoots several holes in the wall; Perry uses a nearby flatscreen TV as cover. Perry grabs another remote from the top of the TV and fires at Doofenshmirtz) Oh, that one shoots too? Whoo! Who knew? (Doofenshmirtz uses a nearby TV as cover as the two fight)"
Phineas," Well, all roads lead to home, I guess. I can't wait to see what they ha..."
Phineas' friends," Happy birthday, Phineas! (the yard is filled with Phineas-shaped balloons, and has a stage with a giant TV screen reading ""Happy Birthday, Phineas"")"
Tabitha Comstock, You're the best!
Isabella," Phineas Flynn, welcome to your birthday! (rockets and stars appear on the TV screen)"
Candace, Hee hee! Hee! Hee! Just a few more blocks and I'm gonna bust my brothers for all the stuff that's on this DVD!
Doofenshmirtz, Ha-HA! I got ya!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great. Now it's pointing in the wrong direction. The wrong direction!"
Candace, (still running down the street) Heeheeheeheehee... Ooh! A dollar! (leans down to pick up the dollar just as the Non-inator's beam passes over her head)

When installing pipes, always make sure the arrows are pointing... (the Non-inator's beam hits the TV, switching the video image with that of Doofenshmirtz)"

Candace, (having picked up the dollar) Hah! (gasps)
Candace," Ha-ha, I made it! Hee, hee, hee, hee..."
Candace, (turns around) AAAAHHH! (the birds dive-bomb her as she runs away) Birds?! What is happening?!?! (she dodges the birds)
Candace, That's it! I made it! I... AAAAHHH! (she trips and launches the DVD into the air) Oh no!
Candace, (seeing a parade of elephants coming down the street) A circus? What the...
Balthazar, Can I have your autograph?
Candace," Oh yeah, baby, it's happenin'."
Doofenshmirtz," (seeing the tilted Non-inator) Oh, now look what you made me do... 40 seconds ago, Perry the Platypus. Now I'm going to have to even out the legs! But first, I'm going to get even with you! (pushes the remote's button, but it doesn't work) I, oh, I, uh, I... I seem to be out of batteries. Could you wait while I go get the, um, uh... (Perry points another remote at Doofenshmirtz and fires) Perry the Platypus, no! (Doofenshmirtz ducks; the remote's laser misses him and hits the Non-inator, which explodes) Okay, maybe the ""-inator"" name wasn't the problem."
Doofenshmirtz," Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (Perry hears this and smiles)"
Linda, I just feel so bad we missed the video presentation while we were at the bakery.
Lawrence," Well, we couldn't very well serve that cake, the way those wild penguins tore it apart, could we? And to think that they were carried away by a freak tornado!"
Candace, (running up) Mom! Mom! Mom!
Linda," Candace, you missed half the party!"
Lawrence, (walking away) Triangular bubbles? How'd they ever do that?
Candace," That's okay, cause this is it-it-it!"
Linda," This is what, Candace?"
Candace, The day I finally win. The day I get what I've been after all summer long!
Linda," Oh, that."
Candace," Because today, I have this! (holds up the DVD)"
Linda, What's that?
Candace," This? Oh, this is only..."
Phineas," (over applause) Thank you, thank you, everyone!"
Linda," Hold on, honey. I think Phineas is going to speak."
Phineas," (on stage) I just have to say, I'm a lucky guy. I mean, so far, this has been a rockin' great summer! I've sure had plenty of fun. But it's not about satisfying your personal desires. It's about all of you. Being surrounded by the best family (Linda and Lawrence hug) and the best friends (Buford and Baljeet tear up) anyone could ever hope to have. All the people I love, (Isabella sighs) and who love me right back. (Irving sighs) Today was a great day. The best day ever!"
Candace," (looks at the DVD, then at Phineas; she starts bawling) WAAHH-HHHAHH! I can't do it! Not on his birthday! I mean, what kind of person am I? (smashes the DVD with the wrench)"
Phineas," (walking up) Aw, Candace. You're a great person! Why, if I had a nickel for every time you did something nice for me... well, I wouldn't know what to do with that much money!"
Candace, But I didn't even get you a...
Phineas, Wait a minute. (pointing at the wrench in Candace's hand) Is that... it is! A left-handed flange tuner! I've been looking for one of those forever!
Candace, You've been... huh?
Phineas," They're impossible to find! Custom-made for Danville's sewage repair, but they have a thousand uses! (takes the wrench) I love it! It's just what I've been wanting! (hugs Candace) Thank you, Candace!"
Candace, (hugs Phineas) You're welcome.
Phineas," You're the best sister ever. (counter appears in the top-right of the screen, reading ""$0.05"")"
Linda," All right, everybody. (next to a cake with a Phineas ornament on top) Who wants cake? (all the kids run up to her, shouting chaotically)"
Buford," Buford wants cake! Buford wants cake! Me, me, me!"
Baljeet, Me! I want the largest piece!
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry. Some day, huh?"
Candace," Yep, and I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. (she and Phineas walk away)"
Clown, Hello? Did somebody order a circus? (beat) Hello? I knew I should've gotten the down payment on the elephants.
