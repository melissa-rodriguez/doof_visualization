Phineas, I think this might be the hottest day on record.
Buford," Wait. (He puts his finger in his mouth, takes it out and the saliva on his finger sizzles.) Yep."
Baljeet," (offscreen) Hi, guys."
Phineas," Hey, Baljeet! How was physics camp?"
Baljeet, Positively remedial. How much more basic can you get than the surface tension of water droplets?
Buford, Surfer tension? What's that?
Baljeet," Surface tension is the property which allows molecules of water on its surface to form a sort of stretchy skin, which allows it to retain its shape and durability at a small size."
Phineas," Cool! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Buford, (watch beeps) Not me.
Baljeet, Really? And what are you doing today?
Buford," With the hurly-burly of my busy social calendar, I often forget to have quality time with my pet goldfish, Biff. (bows) So I shall smell...you later. (he exits)"
Baljeet," Wow, ""Smell you later"" sounds a lot more formal when you bow."
Phineas," Well, Ferb, I know what the rest of us are gonna do today."
Isabella," Speaking of pets, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," (on watch, whispering) Sorry I can't be there, Agent P, (cut to the watch showing Monogram's eyes) but I'm stuck on jury duty. You'll be getting your mission today from Director Dipthong from accounting. Good luck. (gavel bangs, Monogram pulls away and speaks to the offscreen judge) Uh, uh, no, Your Honor, I'm not speaking on a mobile device. I...I'm talking to...a wart on my hand. (to the watch) Go away, wart! Go away!"
Director Dipthong," Hello, Agent P. It's me, Director Dipthong...from accounting. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying an exorbitant amount of negative ion generators and negative power cable and I'm positive that it can't be good. (Perry rolls his eyes) Yeah. Eh, so go find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to and put a stop to it. Descending Dipthong! (He sinks down from the screen)"
Carl, What are you doing?
Director Dipthong," (going back up) It's my signature sign-off. What do you think? ""Descending Dipthong."" (sinks down from the screen again)"
Carl, I'd stick with accounting.
Candace," Can you believe how hot it is today, Jeremy? Even my dollies are sweatin'! Not that I play with dolls. I just happen to have a couple on my shelf next to my unicorn. Heh. (slaps her forehead in realization of what she just said)"
Jeremy, Cool. So what do you wanna do today?
Candace, I don't know. I thought maybe we could head to the mall.
Jeremy, I suppose we could go to the mall again.
Candace's Brain #1," Really? The mall again? Wow, you are so predictable! So ordinary!"
Candace's Brain #2," Predictable? Ordinary? I mean, come on! I play 20 instruments!"
Candace's Brain #1," Yeah, that all start with the letter ""B"", as in boring."
Candace's Brain #3, (skipping daffily) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la... ♪
Candace's Brain #2, Who's that?
Candace's Brain #1, Just pretend she's not there. That's what I do.
Jeremy, (offscreen) Candace?
Jeremy, Candace?! Are you there?
Candace," Uh, yeah. Yes, sorry. Forget the mall. I'm gonna think of something else to do that's really cool and totally different. 'Cause, y'know, I gotta be my unpredictable self, so Candace is out, peace! Uh, y'know what? That's so overused. Candace is out. (daffily) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la ♪ (hangs up)"
Linda," Candace, I'm on my way to...You know, this feels awfully familiar: I tell you I'm going out, later you'll tell me Phineas and Ferb are up to something, but there's nothing there to see, so we all have pie. Just another ordinary day."
Candace," Ordinary?! Do I ordinarily do this? (She pushes her dollies off the shelf and laughs while ripping the sheets off her bed and goes cuckoo again) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, Tra la la la la la LA!!!!! ♪"
Linda," Like I said, just another ordinary day."
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, man, why did I save all the manual labor on my newest inator for the hottest day of the year? I might as well be doing hot yoga up in this piece! Can I get a ""what-what?"" (no response) Norm, where's my ""what-what?"""
Norm," I'm sorry, sir. People do not say that anymore."
Doofenshmirtz, How do you stay so current?
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you have a seat? (A chair lying on its back emerges from the floor and traps Perry) That is not not how you sit on a chair! Which means it is! Because I used a double negative! Sure, it's grammatically incorrect, but it's the core of my newest creation: the Double Negative-inator! It takes any negative statement and turns it into a double negative, which...which, in turn, makes it positive, I... Anyway, I...I was dreaming about cold weather because it's been so hot lately and I remembered how much I loved the Minty Wink Eggnog they make at Beverly's Lunch downtown..."
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) ...so I went out to get one. But then, Beverly told me I couldn't have it because they only make it in the winter. No matter how I begged and pleaded, she stood firm. No Minty Wink Eggnog! Because it's not winter!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ugh! Anyway, once I recovered from the shock, I did what I always do: solve a simple problem by inventing a complicated and menacing machine. All I have to do is blast Beverly with this and bzzt! she'll be like, ""Oh, I guess you can have it, 'cause it's not not winter"" and, suddenly, I'm drinkin' Minty Wink Eggnog, baby! Perhaps then, I can make myself not not ruler of the Tri-State Area! Huh? Huh? You didn't see that coming, did you? (Perry chatters) Oh, don't be cranky, Perry the Platypus, you can have a Minty Wink Eggnog, too."
Phineas," Nice work, guys! (Cut to a wide shot of the backyard to reveal a giant ball of water next to them) We'll have no trouble beating the heat with the world's largest drop of water."
Baljeet," Yes! By my calculations, we have effectively strengthened the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, so that the surface tension is virtually unbreakable! In your face, physics camp! Booyah!"
Phineas," Come on, gang! Let's surf the surface tension! (Cut to reveal Phineas and Isabella surfing on the giant waterball) Cowabunga!"
Isabella, Totally awesome!
Buford," (offscreen) Okay. Today's the big day of the Danville Fish Show. (Cut to Buford's bedroom to reveal he's talking to Biff) Are ya nervous? (Close up on Biff who bubbles.) Don't worry about it. It's normal. Just remember today is your day to shine! So we gonna be scared? (as Biff) No, Bufie! (as himself) Are we gonna be tough? (as Biff) Yes, Bufie! (as himself) So let's see whatcha got! (holding a small hoop) So just like we practiced, jump through the hoop. You can do it, buddy! (He moves the hoop around the fish) Jump through the hoop! (He holds up the bowl) Victory!"
Candace," What'm I gonna do, Stace? Jeremy wants to spend time with me, but the best thing I could come up with is the mall! That's how boring I am!"
Stacy," Well, there's a lot more interesting things to do. At least, that's what my mom says."
Candace," The café, movie theater...it just all seems so...so ordinary. I just gotta find something cool to do to get me outta my rut. Wanna come along?"
Stacy," Nah, I'm sticking to the mall. It's air-conditioned."
Candace, (singing offscreen) ♪ I want to be extraordinary ♪
Phineas," On your marks, (close up to reveal Holly, Baljeet and Django about to start a race) get set, (blows whistle)..."
Phineas, Spherical laps! How cool is that? (Ferb gives a thumbs up)
Phineas, Awesome! The momentum from the swimming action is causing us to roll! Looks like we're takin' this pool party on the road!
Phineas," Hey, you know what? We can totally steer this thing if we paddle opposite the direction that we wanna go!"
Isabella," Seems counter-intuitive, but okay."
Phineas," Full speed ahead, Ferb!"
Phineas," Bumpy street! Dead ahead! (Cut to a street sign that says, ""Bumpy St 3300"". ) And hang a right onto Zigzag Street! (The water ball zigzags on the zigzag shaped road.) Woah! Loop-de-Loop Street!"
Man, At least it's rent-controlled! (Crash!) I'm okay. Happens all the time.
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, a few more tweaks and I'm ready to double down on some negatives! (Perry escapes from his trap and hits Doofenshmirtz on the head with the chair.) Woah I— (Perry jumps on Doofenshmirtz) That double negative did not make a positive! Ow! Oh, you are gonna get it now! (They run into each other but miss. Doofenshmirtz lands on the controls.) Oh no no n-n-no! Now it's stuck in random fire mode! Don't know why I put that mode on there."
Girl 1, Not it!
Girl 2, Not it!
Boy, Not it!
Balthazar, Not not it!
Boy, Get him!
Major Monogram," We, the members of the jury, find the defendant (gets zapped) not not guilty, so I guess we find him guilty. (The bailiff cuffs the defendant and takes him away.) Funny, I coulda sworn he was innocent."
Guard," Hey, can't you see the detour? This is not a through street. (gets zapped) Like I said, it's not not a through street."
Candace, Ugh! This isn't extraordinary! It's just embarrassing!
Phineas," (offscreen) Hey, Candace!"
Candace, Phineas and Ferb?!
Linda," (offscreen) Thanks, Bobbi. (cut to reveal Linda coming out of Bobbi's Hair Salon) I'll see ya next week."
Candace," (smiles) Mom! (runs up to her) Mom, Mom, Mom!!"
Linda," Candace, what on earth is on your head?"
Candace," Nevermind that! Phineas and Ferb are rolling through town on a giant ball of water! Come on! (She grabs hold of her mother and runs, while the fruit hat falls off her head, just like her mother predicted.)"
Linda, What about your fruit hat?!
Announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our next contestants: Rodney von Roddenstein and his pet piranha, Fluffy, with their hoop trick!"
Rodney, Tada!
Announcer," What a terrific new twist to a timeless old trick. Let's see what the judges have to say. (The judges put up their scores, 9, 8, and 9) Wow! That puts Rodney and Fluffy in the lead (Cut to Rodney who reveals he had a false hand) and almost impossible to beat! Next up are Buford and his pet goldfish, Biff, with their version of the hoop jump trick. (Buford smiles nervously) Good luck, toppin' that one, guys!"
Buford," Okay, Biffy, we're up! (The ground starts to shake) Jump through the—"
Baljeet, Oh no! Public art! Right ahead!
Isabella, It must be part of the Public Art Relocation Program!
Buford," You did it, Biff! We're number one!"
Phineas," Congrats, guys!"
Buford, Thanks! I'm gonna put Biff's prize money in a scholarship fund for that fancy fish school in the Maldives!
Candace, Wait until you see this giant ball of water!
Phineas," (offscreen) Hi, guys!"
Phineas, Come on in! The water's great!
Linda," You're right, Candace. There is a ""giant ball of water"". Though most people prefer to call it a lake. (walks away)"
Jeremy, Wow! A party in the lake? I never would have thought of that! You come up with the best ideas! We can go to the mall tomorrow.
Candace, You really want to go to the mall again?
Jeremy, We're teenagers. It's what we do.
Doofenshmirtz," Ha! Ya mi— Ow! (falls backwards breaking a table with water and cupcakes on it) That was refreshing. (Perry puts his foot on a button on the controls and an explosion is seen from the building. Perry makes his escape on his parachute.) Ah, that was not not the self-destruct button. (Cut back to Doofenshmirtz in the mess in his lab.) Ugh! Well, oh, man, once again, the place is trashed! You just take off, leaving me here to clean it all up. (Putting on an apron and getting a broom and dustpan) Does it ever occur to you, Perry the Platypus, how much of a mess is left after one of our little tête-à-têtes? I betcha it never even occurred to you that I keep talking to you for a while after you've gone! I mean, it's probably a sad commentary on my life that I'm wearing an apron and talking to a platypus that's no longer...How long have you been standing there, Vanessa?"
Vanessa," (offscreen) Long enough, Dad."
