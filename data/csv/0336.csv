Phineas," Well, Perry, as soon as I send in your photo you'll be a contestant in the Totally Tools spokes-animal contest. (looks at Perry) What do you say boy? Ready to be a spokes-animal?"
Phineas,That's the spirit! (does some typing) And send. (pushes a button on keyboard)
Phineas,Hello?
Phineas,Perry won!
Mandy," Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Stop the Busting Retreat, a one-day seminar to teach us all to use sisterly restraint. And today, we welcome our newest member, Candace Flynn. Candace, this is Anne, Sunisa and Danielle."
Candace," (waves a hand) Yeah, hi."
Mandy," What we like to do now is a little exercise. We'll start with you, Anne. (clicks a button on a remote) This is your picture of your brother turning your mother's flower bed into a swimming pool. What do you do?"
Anne," Well, being a non-buster, I'll probably go to the mall and get a mani-pedi."
Mandy," Good! (at Candace) See how it's done, Candace? (clicks button again) Think you can do that?"
Candace, Ha! Are you kidding? Just try me.
Mandy," Okay, so, (clicks button for the third time) you see your brothers making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, You...?"
Candace," Well, being a non-buster, I wouldn't bust them for making a sandwich. But I'd bust them for making a sandwich when it's 5:30 in the afternoon, and we'll all be having supper in a half-hour! They'll ruin their appetites! They are so busted!"
Mandy," Okay, who here can tell me where Candace's approach could use a little improving? (Everyone except Mandy raises their hand) Candace, put your hand down."
Manager," Okay, welcome to Totally Tools. Now, where is that contest-winning platypus of yours? (gasps) Oh, will you look at him. Oh, and he sits up, too! Who says they don't do much? Brilliant! But sitting up isn't enough. He has to say, ""Totally Tools"". (pause) I got nothing. What do you guys think?"
Phineas, How about a hat?
Manager, Brilliant!
Phineas," Ferb, I know we're gonna do today. We're gonna put a hat on Perry. (places a hat on Perry's head)"
Manager," Hang on a minute. Wait, go back two."
Manager," Brilliant! (picks up Perry, now wearing a... fedora) Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora. Boys, he's got a lot of work to do. (hands Perry to Phineas) Get busy!"
Phineas," Come on, Ferb. (runs off with Ferb following him)"
Manager, Those boys are brilliant!
Assistant," Sir, your 10:30 balloon is here."
Manager, Brilliant!
Major Monogram," Mmm, hello?"
Doofenshmirtz," (off-screen) Francis! Hi, it's me, Heinz."
Doofenshmirtz, Have you seen Perry the Platypus?
Major Monogram," Dr. Doofenshmirtz, that information is highly classified and strictly confidential."
Doofenshmirtz, You have no idea where he is.
Major Monogram, Not a clue.
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, thanks!"
Major Monogram," Oh, hey, hang on. Say, what kind of an evil scheme you got going on there today?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, it isn't so much an evil scheme as much as a childish prank, but I've invented a Mustache-inator! (pause) It gives people big, bushy, ridiculous-looking mustaches. Because, as we all know, there's nothing sillier than a big, bushy... (chuckles nervously) All right, uh, uh... But hey, you know, it looks good on you!"
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, today we give you the new face of Totally Tools, (blue curtains opens) Perry the Platypus!"
Man in audience, Yeah! Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora.
Manager," Boys, this campaign of yours has really put us over the top. What else you got?"
Phineas," Well, Ferb came up with an idea for an exploding billboard."
Manager, Brilliant!
Boy," Hey, look! It's a Totally Tools publicity stunt."
Man, Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora hanging from a blimp!
Major Monogram," Oh, hello, Agent P. We have a situation. With all these new billboards up all over town, you've become too recognizable to be a secret agent. So we had to send Agent S to Doofenshmirtz's in your place. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go on hiatus until your 15 minutes of fame are up."
Manager," I gotta tell you, boys, our president, Tom Totally, thinks you're doing such a brilliant job!"
Manager,He wants you to take the rest of the day off.
Phineas," Sounds great. (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. We can spend the rest of the day with you for a change."
Doofenshmirtz, Pew! A handlebar. Pew! A pencil thin. Pew! Fu Manchu!
Doofenshmirtz,"Well, now, who could that be? All right, already! (walks to the door) This better be important, or you are gonna get such a mustache..."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm, well, this should be easy. You've fallen for my trap! (cackles) Huh? You may have survived that trap, but let's you escape the cage! Ha-ha! Oh, for Pete's sake! Will nothing stop you?"
Candace," Okay, this is quite a jump from group affirmations. How is this contraption supposed to help me resist the urge to bust my brothers?"
Mandy," It's a positive reinforcement machine. When you ignore your busting impulses, you get a reward. Let's try it out."
Mandy,You go out in your backyard and find that your brothers have built a rocket ship. What do you do?
Candace," Well, I'm just gonna... I ignore it?"
Automated voice," Ooh! Who's a good girl? You are the good girl. Yes, you are."
Doofenshmirtz," There! That ought to hold you. Lucky thing Mrs. Thompson had some salt I could borrow. (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, consider yourself ""a salted"". Ah, man, I'm writing that one down. And now, to business. See that guy there with the beard?"
Doofenshmirtz,"Pew! (cackles) Actually, that was kind of a letdown."
Phineas," Fetch the ball, Perry!"
Major Monogram," (on wrist communicator) Agent P, Doof found Agent S's weakness. We need you to drop everything and return to duty."
Major Monogram,"I know we gave you some time off, but could you please come back in to work? (pleading) Please? (normal voice) I can't hold my eyes like this much longer."
Mandy," Now, Candace, your brothers have issued a gold-based currency which has seriously devalued the euro. What do you do?"
Candace, (laughs) I do nothing!
Automated voice," You are the good girl, yes, you are!"
Candace," Wow, you were right. This is quite a machine. Where did you get it, anyway?"
Mandy, Phineas and Ferb made it for... (covers her mouth with a hand)
Candace, What did you say?
Mandy, N-n-n-nothing. (screams)
Candace," Phineas and Ferb, why do you always build these things? It's impossible to bust you for everything! It's not my job! Not my job! (realizes) Not my job?"
Mandy," Candace, you had your breakthrough! (hugs Candace) I'm so proud of you."
Doofenshmirtz, Ha! Did you see that? I just put a mustache on that dog's...
Doofenshmirtz,"What a guy! Not so famous you can't stop by to trounce an old nemesis, are you, huh? But you can't!"
Doofenshmirtz,It's against the O.W.C.A. by-laws. (puts on reading glasses)
Doofenshmirtz,"And I quote, ""No additional agents are allowed to thwart any single evil scientist if said first agent assigned is still well and able to carry out his duties."" And though surrounded by salt, Sergei the Snail is technically still ""on duty,"" so as long as I have him trapped, you can't touch me! It's all here in black and and... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!"
Candace," Well, ladies, thanks for everything."
Candace,"I feel like... (notices billboards) Uh, Perry? Perry? Perry? .... Oh, my gosh, the boys have created an enormous ad campaign around our pet platypus!"
Mandy, Uh-oh.
Candace," (inhales deeply) Sisters, I know what you're thinking, but rest assured, this new Candace that you see before you will not react like the crazed little girl that crawled in here just this morning."
Mandy," Good for you, Candace!"
Candace," For now, I am, and will always be, an older sister who is positive and mature."
Mandy," That's right, Candace."
Candace," And I am absolutely 100% positive that I have to bust my brothers. I can see it in your eyes! You know I'm right! Sisters, will we bust our brothers?"
Mandy, Yes!
All," Yes, we will!"
Candace," Sisters, repeat after me. Bust! Bust! Bust..."
All, Bust! Bust! Bust!.... (repeats)
Mandy," (stops chanting, realizing something) Whoa, whoa, whoa! What just happened?"
Doofenshmirtz," Just for the record, Perry the Platypus, I was thwarted by Sergei the Snail, not you! You don't get any credit for this."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Carl," Uh, sir, you're playing with your lip again."
Major Monogram," Oh, I can't help it, Carl. I miss the old duster."
Major Monogram,"What the..? (at Carl) Hey, Carl! It's back! Look how great it... (moves; realizes the mustache isn't on his face) Oh. (taps the screen) Oh, doggone it!"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, that was interesting. You defaced yourself. (pause) I didn't see that coming. To be honest, you have lost me completely."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hey! (stammering) Wow, I look just like my grandfather, Jose Doofenshmirtz. I mentioned him before. It's... it's a weird story. I'll tell you later. You know, after I shave."
Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, what are you..."
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, curse you, Perry the Mustachioed Tool Spokespus!"
Manager," But, Mr. Totally, I have no idea who put those mustaches on those posters. It wasn't my fault!"
Mr. Totally, I want every one of these ad torn down totally! They're mocking me!
Manager," Yes, sir. Yes, sir, all torn down. Brilliant! (crashes) Trash can!"
Candace," Oh, they are so busted!"
Candace,"Okay, how she missed that one is beyond me."
Candace,Mom! Mom! Mom!
Linda," Well, I guess that answered the inflatable legs question. (at Candace) Now, what is it, Candace?"
Candace, Look and see for yourself! You won't believe it!
Linda, Candace...
Candace," Okay, now, look up there! (points toward the billboard)"
Linda, I'm astonished.
Candace, Yes! Finally!!
Linda," ""Nothing says Totally Tools like a snail in a fedora."""
Linda,"It makes me want to run right out and buy some tools. (at Candace) Now, if you'll excuse me, I had better get back to the attic before your father blows up another pair... (Inflatable legs burst off camera) Oops, too late. (runs off) I'm coming, dear! And I have the patch kit."
