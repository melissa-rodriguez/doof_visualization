Linda," (from inside) All right Candace. (Cuts to the kitchen where she picks up her purse on the counter, where Candace is sitting and dialing her phone.) I'm off to the grocery store. You're in charge."
Candace," Whoa-whoa-whoa wai-wai-wait! By ""in charge"", does that mean I'm in control of everything around here while you're gone?"
Linda, (turning around) Yes.
Candace, Including Phineas and Ferb? I'm the complete overlord of them?
Linda," (suspiciously) Suddenly I'm a little scared. But, technically, yes."
Candace," So like, in a court of law, any—"
Linda," Candace, I'll be back later. (leaves)"
Candace," (deeply) Excellent! (singsong, to something offscreen) Oh, boys?"
Candace," Hear ye, hear ye! Mom has left me in charge, so I hereby demand that you do nothing crazy today. No building any whoosy-whatzits, or goozy-mahookoffs! In other words, don't be the world's most annoying brothers for one afternoon, okay?"
Female Voice," Your brothers are annoying you, too?"
Girl (cont'd)," Hi, I'm Mandy. (opens the fence gate and approaches Candace) And me and my world's most annoying brothers are visiting our aunt next door for the weekend."
Candace," Oh, you're Mrs. Weaver's niece. You have annoying brothers?"
Mandy," Oh, my gosh! My brothers, Thaddeus and Thor, are constantly building the most annoying contraptions on Earth! Soapbox cars with lawn mower engines..."
Candace, (offscreen) Uh-huh.
Mandy, ...tire swings that launch over the roof...
Candace, (offscreen) Uh-huh!
Mandy, ...a mini shopping center for the cat!
Candace, Finally! Someone who relates! Listen to how annoying Phineas and Ferb are. One time...
Thaddeus," (snaps) Gum me. (Thor gives his brother a gum ball, which he chews and blows.) 'Sup, chumps? Thaddeus. Thor. Overheard you two like to build stuff. Where we come from, we're known as the best. Jealous?"
Phineas," No. No, I'm not."
Thaddeus," Well, you should be. Today, we're building the most awesome fort ever. What do you think of that, suckers?! Ha! Hahahahaha!"
Phineas, Cool. (waves) Good luck. (Ferb gives a thumbs up as Thaddeus and Thor exit the scene. Phineas suddenly gets a cool demeanor on his face as he snaps.) Gum me.
Ferb, Puh-lease.
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram, Agent P? Agent P?
Major Monogram," Agent P? Where is he, Carl?"
Carl," (offscreen) I don't know, sir. Maybe he decided to quit."
Major Monogram," Quit? Well, why would he wanna do that?"
Carl," (offscreen) Well, remember his last mission? You were pretty tough on him, sir."
Major Monogram," Hmm. You're right, Carl. I can be pretty rough sometimes. (sadly) Poor Agent P. Do you think the little guy will ever forgive me? (Perry finally drops into his chair to see Monogram crying, but he then looks up happily) Oh, uh, Agent P, you're here! Ahem! (seriously) So, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been sighted in the Danville Park. We need you to make sure no one is in any danger. (Perry salutes and leaves) There he goes. (guiltily) Jeez, Carl, just hope I wasn't too rough on him this time."
Carl," (offscreen) I don't know, sir. He looked pretty upset to me."
Major Monogram, (putting his head in his hand) I hate myself.
Mandy," I dunno, Candace. In terms of obnoxiousness, I'm sure my brothers have your brothers beat."
Candace," Ha! I beg to differ. Yes, they're both obnoxious, but my brothers' stuff has a sprinkling of awesomeness...which makes it that much more annoying!"
Mandy," Um, have you not been listening? Today, my brothers are building a fort and it'll probably be the most obnoxiously awesome fort ever built!"
Candace, Not if my brothers are building one!
Mandy, Oh yeah?!
Candace," Yeah! It's on, sister!"
Thaddeus," Well, Thor, I know who we're gonna outdo today!"
Candace, There you are! I order you to get out there and build a fort!
Phineas, I thought you wanted us to take the day off and not annoy you.
Candace, Those kids next door are building a fort and I will be annoyed if theirs is better than yours!
Phineas," Candace, we don't do this to compete. We do it for fun."
Ferb, And for the ladies. Rrrrrow. (raises eyebrows seductively)
Candace," Well, do it cuz I say so!"
Doofenshmirtz," (disgruntled) Oh, hi, Perry the Platypus. Welcome to the Doofenshmirtz family reunion. They're just about to start the dreaded kickball game that my mother organizes every year. The one my brother's team always wins. You see, I'm not very coordinated with my feet. But with my hands...Hey, watch this. (Doof reaches offscreen and grabs a table with several cups on them. He does a few impressive stacking tricks with the cups.) See? I hold the cup-stacking world record. But does my mother care? No! (pushes the table offscreen) You see, Perry the Platypus, throughout my childhood, my mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball. You know, I think—I think this is best expressed through song. (strums a balalaika)"
Doofenshmirtz," (to the tune of ""You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart"") ♪ My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball, ♪"
Doofenshmirtz,"Ladies and gentlemen, Love Händel!"
Danny, ♪ Oh yeah! ♪
Doofenshmirtz, ♪ I still got no coordination! ♪
Danny, ♪ He couldn't kick his way right into her heart. ♪
Danny,"Goodnight, Gimmelshtump!"
Doofenshmirtz," How do you like that, Perry the Platypus? Love Händel, in my flashback! I know people. (Perry just gives him a look.) This year, it's going to be different! W-W-Wait right here, I'll show you! (He exits offscreen. We hear a mechanical noise, and he comes back with an electronic leg.) Behold, the Kickinator 5000! Could you help me practice, please, please? Just take the ball and go over there and then just roll it to me. Go ahead. Any time. I'm ready. (The ball rolls to Doof, but nothing happens.) Well, you—you threw it too early! (Gets the ball back) Couldn't you tell I wasn't ready? (He throws the ball back and Perry catches it) Come on, try again. Okay, do it right this time. (The Kickinator 5000 suddenly kicks Doof's chin and he lands on his bottom. The ball rolls off.) It's, uh, you know, it's a process."
Isabella, What'cha doin'?
Phineas, Building a fort.
Isabella, What are you doing?
Thaddeus, Showin' two chumps how to build a fort!
Isabella," Oh, no, he di'n't! Phineas, how can I help?"
Mandy," Stainless steel 18-8 woodscrews, eh? (scoffs) The choice of amateurs!"
Candace, Why? What kind of screws are your brothers using?
Mandy, That's classified.
Candace, Isabella! Get a tarp over that thing ASAP!
Isabella, What color?
Thaddeus," Hey, where's Harry?"
Harry, Yo! Over here!
Thaddeus," Well, he is a contractor. They don't do much."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, slowly. Not so fast! I can hardly keep up with it!"
Female Voice," Heads up, Heinz!"
Doofenshmirtz," You know what? Just—Just bring the ball in front of the Kickinator. Just—Put it right th—What are you doing? I didn't say a mile away! Right here! Bring it closer. Okay. No, no! Oh. That's a little bit better. Step back and get ready to witness some real kicking. (He kicks the ball perfectly, and the ball goes into a tree. A bird falls out.) I did it! I did it! (The Kickinator kicks his chin again and he falls on his back.) I still did it!"
Candace," Alright, guys, it's do or die time. This is the chance to really show your stuff, cuz there's no you're gonna lose to a couple of lame-os AND THEIR LOSER SISTER!!"
Mandy, (offscreen) I can hear you!
Candace," I KNOW!! I SAID IT LOUD!!!! (car honks, Candace gasps) Mom! Gotta get rid of her!"
Candace," Oh, Mom, you're home, you're home! But, uh, I-I think you should go back to the grocery store."
Linda, Why?
Candace," Because I—I bet you forgot, uh, that stuff!"
Linda," (looks at her list) Oh, I guess I did. (gives Candace some bags) Alright, throw these in the kitchen and I'll be right back."
Candace," Boy, that was close."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, I'm next!"
Charlene," (on the mound) Alright, easy out! Everybody move in!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, you're not even a Doofenshmirtz anymore!"
Charlene, I kept the name!
Vanessa," (from the bleachers) You can do it, Dad! (to the person sitting next to her) He can't really do it."
Mandy," (on a megaphone) Welcome, citizens of Danville! I give you the architectural stylings of Thaddeus and Thor!"
Isabella, That's nice.
Candace, Pfft.
Thaddeus," What you architectural illiterates see here is a split-level edifice, complete with slide and licorice dispenser. (He pushes a button and a piece of red licorice comes out.) Huh? What?"
Candace," (on megaphone) People, people, I'm not gonna soft pedal this. That was adequate, but I think we're ready to witness the greatest architectural feat this town has ever seen! I give you Phineas and Ferb!"
Thaddeus, Ha ha ha ha ha! You call that an architectural feat?! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Candace, What?! (drops her megaphone) Have you lost your minds?! You've completely humiliated me in front of everyone!
Phineas," But, Candace, this—"
Candace," Phineas, all summer long, you build the most amazing things and the one time I reach out to you as a sister, the one time I count on you, you give me this?"
Phineas," But, Candace—"
Candace, No! Just leave me alone! (runs off) Excuse me!
Phineas," Candace, wait!"
Vanessa, Woah!
Mrs. Doofenshmirtz, Woah!
Phineas," (picking up the megaphone) Ladies and gentlemen, topping our fort is our homage to old-school construction. And now for the rest of it. Ferb?"
Phineas, Tada! (the kickball hits the fort) Our modern take on a well-known classic!
Doofenshmirtz," I...I did it. I did it! Ha ha! Who's the loser now, huh?! L-O-S-E-R! Who's the loser?! You are! Let's boogie! That's right! Let's boogie!"
Roger, You're out.
Mrs. Doofenshmirtz," (running down from the bleachers) Oh, Roger, my son! (lifts her son up) You make me so proud, again!"
Doofenshmirtz, But... (The Kickinator kicks Doof again) OW!
Phineas," Well, here's the foyer. All imported marble, by the way. Here's the bowling alley. Pool. Telescope. Terra cotta army room. JET ENGINE WIND TUNNEL! And scoring stage with 40-piece orchestra."
Ferb," We don't, however, have a licorice dispenser. That was a nice touch."
Phineas," Yeah, that rocked."
Mandy," Nice going. You broke their brains. Come on, boys. I'm taking you home."
Linda," Hey, I got the stuff."
Candace," Thanks, Mom. At least you came through."
Mandy," Well, Candace, as much as I hate to say this, your brothers are the best. (walks away, to her brothers) A ten-story addition with a swimming pool! Ugh! Why didn't you think of that?!"
Candace, (smiles) Could it be true?!
Linda," (offscreen) Candace, have you seen this?"
Candace," I'm looking at it! ...Wait, where are you?"
Linda, (offscreen) In the kitchen!!
Linda (cont'd)," When I said, ""throw these in the kitchen,"" I didn't mean it literally!!!"
Candace," Yeah yeah yeah. Come on, Mom! (exits)"
Linda, Candace!!! I'm not going anywhere until you take care of this mess!!!
Phineas," Well, fun's fun, but there are those pesky zoning laws."
Doofenshmirtz," Ooooh, I just felt a disturbance in the cup-stacking universe. I think my record's been broken."
Linda," That wasn't so hard, now, was it?"
Candace," (smiles, grabbing her mother) Mom, let's go, let's go, let's go! (Cut to outside) Mom, I've been trying to tell you all summer! They make these amazing things! Look!"
Linda," Candace, you're right! It is amazing!"
Phineas," Hey, Mom, we've built a fort."
Linda, It's wonderful! (to Candace) Isn't it great? The boys are starting to take an interest in building things. (goes back into the house) Who wants stuff?
Phineas, (offscreen) We do!
