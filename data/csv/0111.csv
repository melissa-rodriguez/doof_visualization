Baljeet, We’re going to the circus! We’re going to the circus!
Baljeet, I am here and ready to go to the world-famous Cirque de Lune.
Phineas, Have a seat. We’re goin’ in a minute.
Baljeet, Ok. We’re going to the circus! We’re going to circus!
Lawrence," Well, hold your horses, kids. It says here that the lead of Cirque de Lune has a severe allergy. They’re canceling today’s performance."
Isabella," Well, that’s a bummer!"
Linda, If it’s anything like Candace’s parsnip allergy... (huffs) ...I don’t blame them for not wanting to appear in public.
Phineas," (to Isabella) She gets blotchy. Red, weird voice thingy. (whispering) Not good."
Linda," Well, honey, looks like that frees you up to join me at the mall. Our trio is recording our first album today: Live at the Squat ‘n’ Stitch."
Lawrence," Mmm-mmm, should be swinging."
Linda," Cheer up, guys. I’m sure you’ll have a fun day anyway. Bye, kids, be good. Have fun!"
Isabella, It must be so cool to be in the circus.
Phineas," Yeah. (snaps his fingers) Hey, Ferb, let’s put on our own cirque. This'll be great! Ferb can set up the tent, I’ll be the ringmaster."
Isabella, We can sew up some arty costumes.
Django," Hey, for a trick, I can put my leg over my head. … Ow. I’ll work on it."
Phineas, Even Perry can have an act! The Amazing Perry!
Baljeet," Ooh, I have a mystical, magical art I would like to perform. It’s stupefying!"
Buford, I have another act that’ll bring the house down!
Phineas," Ferb, get the tools!"
Isabella, Let’s do this!
Candace," (yawning) Good morning, Jeremy. (fake boy voice) Good morning, gorgeous. (normal voice) Oh, Jer! (giggles)"
Candace,"I’ll be right back, Jeremy. What’s going on? A circus? Why can’t they give me a break for one day?"
Phineas," This looks great, Ferb."
Phineas,"Hey, have you seen Perry? I put on his costume."
Major Monogram," (clearing his throat) Okay, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is buying bio-mechanical equipment and… (chuckles) elocution tapes. (laughing) We don’t know why. Where are you going, Agent P? Wait, wait, wait, wait, don’t go. I’m not laughing at you. I just heard a funny joke earlier this morning. Please-please, Agent P. Turn around so we can conclude our meeting."
Major Monogram,Carl! Carl! Carl! What’s your e-mail? (still laughing) Gonna send this to you.
Buford," Hey, twerp, I brought the props for my act."
Phineas," Buford, what exactly is your act?"
Buford, I fly into mud with a paper bag on my head.
Phineas," Okay, then."
Buford, The peeps are gonna love.
Candace," I’m not even gonna call Mom. No, not gonna call!"
Linda," Candace, honey, listen. I can’t talk. We’re recording. Is it life or death?"
Candace," Well, no, but…"
Linda, I gotta go! Bye!
Candace, (growls in frustration)
Jeremy," Hey-ah, Candace."
Candace," Oh! Hi, Jeremy."
Jeremy, My mom told me to bring over these homegrown veggies for your family. You know; she and your mom are doing that jazz thing today.
Candace, Thanks!
Jeremy," So, circus, huh? Cool. Cool. I guess it’s more of a cirque than a “circus”. (laughs)"
Candace, Oh. (giggles)
Jeremy, Don’t you think?
Candace, What?
Jeremy, Don’t you think we should sit together to watch the show? If-if you want to.
Candace," Yeah, yeah."
Jeremy," Uh, Candace, are you okay?"
Candace," Say, are there any wild parsnips in here?"
Jeremy," Uh, I think that’s all that’s in there."
Candace, (choked gasp) Later.
Man," I’m dancing with your wife, pal. You got a problem with that?"
Doofenshmirtz," I’m dance-- (clears throat) “I’m dancing with your wife, pal. You got a problem with that?” Oh, yes, that does sound tough."
Man," Yeah, I ate your last nectarine. You got a problem with that?"
Doofenshmirtz," Yes, I ate--"
Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, look. Could-could you use the front door from now on? Could you just do that for me? I mean, yes, “I ate your last nectarine. You got a problem with that?” Sounds tough, huh? But not tough enough!"
Doofenshmirtz,"You see; ever since I was a child, I have had a high, squeaky voice! But not anymore. Behold, the Voice-inator! It bio-mechanically transforms normal air into Doofelium, which’ll make everyone else’s voice higher, making my voice deeper by comparison. I was going to lower my own voice, but, you know, it seemed like too much trouble."
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on!"
Candace," Of course it had to be wild parsnips. Allergy pills, allergy pills. A-ha! Quick! Before my voice goes through the reaction."
Girl," Hey, Jeremy. Wanna sit together at the show?"
Candace," No, no, Mindy can’t sit with Jeremy. Gotta stop this, gotta tell Mom! Can’t go out looking like this!"
Mindy," So, how about us sitting together?"
Candace, 'Scuse me.
Jeremy," Oh, it’s good, bro. (to Mindy) Thanks, but I promised Candace."
Phineas," We’re moments away from Ferb and The Amazing Perry! (to Ferb) Hey, Ferb. You guys are up next. Where’s Perry?"
Phineas," Oh, there you are."
Baljeet," And now, for my final trick, I will reattach my thumb! Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, come thumb, it’s healing time."
Phineas," Let’s hear it for Baljeet the Stupefying! But now, prepared to be astounded when The Amazing Semi-aquatic Perry, aided by Ferb, attempts to jump through that hoop into the Shallow Pond!"
Audience, Ooh!
Phineas, Yeah! Let’s hear it for the Amazing Semi-aquatic Perry!
Candace," Psst, Mom."
Linda," Candace, have you been near the wild parsnips again?"
Candace," Yes, but you gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing."
Linda, What is it now?
Candace, ♪ Those boys are always up to something♪
Vivian," Testify, Candace, testify!"
Candace, ♪ Those boys are evil♪
Candace,"Let me spell it out for you, Mom"
Candace,Everybody!
Candace,That's what I'm talking about
Candace," Okay, Mom, so you gonna come home with me?"
Linda," Are you kidding, hon?! Let’s do another!"
Candace, (groans)
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, but you are too late. … Wait! Wait, don’t touch that! … Stop it! Stop it! (chuckling) Stop it, I told you! Stop it! I said keep your hands off of that."
Buford," Hey, I got my costume all set. Be sure to introduce me as The Amazing Baggo."
Phineas," You know, we’ve been thinking about your act and have some suggestions. Modify your torque and reverse the angle of trajectory."
Buford," I still get to land in the mud, right?"
Phineas," Oh, yeah, yeah."
Buford, I want the mud.
Phineas," Thank you, Django, the Human Pretzel!"
Django, (moaning)
Phineas," That’s gotta hurt. And now, our next act will catapult through the heavens, and land in a pit filled with the mysterious Aztec mud of doom!"
Audience, Whoo!
Candace, Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! (gasps) He saved me a seat.
Phineas, I give you The Amazing Baggo!
Buford, Ta-da...hey!
Candace," Guys, cut it out. Let go!"
Buford, That dude’s stealing my act!
Ferb, (whistles)
Phineas, Hmm. He must have been lighter than we calculated.
Buford," No, no! This is Buford’s moment to shine. … Hey, everybody. Over here."
Phineas, Wait. How’d he get down there?
Ferb, Perhaps Buford truly is amazing.
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great! Now this thing's broken."
Phineas," And now, ladies and gentlemen, (voice-pitch rising) I give you our entire cast in our grand finale, featuring The Amazing Perry!"
Doofenshmirtz," Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Linda," Hi, guys."
Phineas," Mom, Dad, you missed our cirque."
Linda," Well, it sure looks like you had fun."
Perry, (chatters)
Linda, Who wants to hear my CD?
Phineas," Ooh, I do!"
Lawrence," All right, come on."
Phineas, Cool.
Candace," (moans) Oh, well, at least I’m back to normal."
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. My mom played me some of their CD. Your singing is awesome! How’d you get your voice to sound like that?"
Candace," Oh, same as all the great blues singers. Wild parsnips."
