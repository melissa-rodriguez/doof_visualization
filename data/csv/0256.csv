Linda," (from inside) Enough moping around, Candace. (cut to inside Candace's room where Candace is sitting on her bed, she approaches her.) Phineas and Ferb said they've devised a fun way to wash the house. Why don't you join them? Have some fun for a change!"
Candace, For a change? I have lots of fun!
Linda," You mean, obsessively trying to bust your brothers for their mystery crimes? Is that ""fun""?"
Candace, I have fun. I'm like the queen of fun! I have fun all day!
Linda," I can tell. Well, if you just sit inside today, you should at least do a little reading."
Candace," Aw, Mom?"
Linda, It's one of my favorites.
Candace, The Wizard of Oz. Isn't this for babies?
Linda, Or you could wipe down Perry's platypus plaza play set.
Candace," (Opens book) I'm reading, I'm reading!"
Linda," Well, I'll be at my weight lifting class. Have fun!"
Candace," Ah! Oh, my eyes hurt! (to a picture of Jeremy) Oh, Jeremy, you're the only one who understands-"
Buford," Hi, Candace!"
Candace," AHH! Buford, Baljeet, what do you two want?"
Buford," What, like in a metaphysical sense? Nothing. I'm good."
Baljeet, I want to be cool!
Buford, That's not gonna happen.
Baljeet, Oh....
Candace," I mean, why are you looking in my window, duh!"
Buford," Oh, Ferb says I should tell you we're about to start washing the house, and you can help us out if you want!"
Candace, Not likely.
Buford," Either way, you might want to put on some waterproof undergarments."
Candace, Will you get out of here?!?
Candace," (opens book again) Blah blah Dorothy, blah blah Kansas. There's a cyclone coming?"
Phineas," Okay Ferb, let her lift."
Candace, (Flies off bed) AH!
Phineas," Take your positions everybody! And remember, even strokes."
Baljeet, Do you guys always wash the house like this?
Phineas," Sometimes, we give it a bath,"
Phineas,but the city's using the tub as a reservoir.
Candace, Whoa! What's happening? (Gargling) Phineas! Ferb!
Phineas, Okay. Full speed now!
Linda, (echoes) Try to have fun!
Baljeet, (echoes) I want to be cool!
Talking Zebra, (echoes) Hello.
Buford, (echoes) I don't want nothin'!
Baljeet, (echoes) Waterproof undergarments! Wheeeeeeeee!
Phineas, (echoes) Hey! I wonder where Perry went?
Candace, Ew! Gross! Perry!
Candace,"Oh, wow! (Her perspective of a different landscape) Perry, I don't think we're in Danville anymore."
Dream Fireside Girl," You're in Patchkinland! We're Patchkins, and we welcome you because,... (sing-song) Little Witch Suzy was a louse, now she's squished under your house!"
Little Witch Suzy, (muffled) I'm alright!
Dream Fireside Girl, I have saliva.
Candace, Gross!
Dream Fireside Girl, Eyeball!
The Patchkins, Eyeball! Eyeball!
"The Good-Witch, Isabella"," What'cha doin'? (walks up to Candace) I'm The Good-Witch, Isabella. Welcome to Patchkinland!"
Little Witch Suzy, (muffled) Hello?! Can someone get this off me?!
Doofenwitch Warlock, (shouting in the background) Don't touch those boots!!!
The Patchkins, Witch! Witch! Witch!
Doofenwitch Warlock," Not witch, Warlock! It's a robe! Not a dress!"
Doofenwitch Warlock,I suppose I should thank you for squishing little Suzy.
Little Witch Suzy," (muffled) I'm okay, if you'd just lift this house off me!"
Doofenwitch Warlock," But I won't, because I'm wicked! Heeheehee. I'll just take these little boots, and be right on my--"
Doofenwitch Warlock,What? What happened?!? Where are my boots?!?
"The Good-Witch, Isabella", Right there... on Candace.
Little Witch Suzy, (muffled) Now my feet are cold.
Doofenwitch Warlock, Give me those boots!
"The Good-Witch, Isabella", She doesn't have to give you anything! You have no real power in this part of Odd!
Doofenwitch Warlock," Wrong! I have the power of positive thinking! True, it doesn't really... help me this instance, but you can't stay in Patchkinland forever! That's right! I'll get you,... and your little platypus too."
Perry, (Growls back defiantly)
Doofenwitch Warlock," Now, check me out as I disappear into an evil cloud of black smoke! Ha ha!"
Doofenwitch Warlock,"You know, I'm just gonna use my bus pass."
Little Witch Suzy, (muffled) Seriously! Can someone get a jack or something?
Candace," I don't know how, but I bet Phineas and Ferb are behind all of this!"
Phineas," Oh, hi, Candace!"
Candace, I knew it!
Phineas, Have fun!
Candace," Wait! Stop! How did you--? (Growls in frustration, then walks toward The Good-Witch, Isabella)"
Candace,"Alright, Eyeball girl! Where can I go to bust someone around here?"
"The Good-Witch, Isabella", You can always try Bustopolis. That's where the wizard lives.
Candace, Can the wizard bust my brothers?
"The Good-Witch, Isabella", You bet'cha!
Candace, How do I get there?

Nerdcrow (Baljeet)," For some of us, it is a world away!"
Candace, What are you supposed to be?
Nerdcrow (Baljeet)," I am a nerdcrow. I hang in cornfields, wedgie-style, to keep the crows away. They would not be caught dead anywhere around me. For you see, despite of my above average mathematical skills, I am not cool."
Candace," That's fascinating. But, I'm on my way to Bustopolis to ask the wizard to bust my brothers."
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), The Wizard?!? (falls to the ground) Oof! Do you think the wizard can do something for me?
Candace, What do you want?
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Allow me to put it in song!
Candace, (interrupting) Alright! That's enough!
Candace,"I get it. You want to Bustopolis and ask the wizard for coolness, right?"
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), (eagerly) Do I!

Candace," Oh, no. No, we are staying on the yellow sidewalk."
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Do I have a say in this matter?
Candace, No. Let's go!
Nerdcrow (Baljeet)," Yes, Candace."
Phineas," Sorry you're gonna miss out on all of the fun! (to Ferb) I'll race you to marshmallow meadow, Ferb. (while riding unicorn with Ferb down the horse path) Well, this is fun. It's a little girly for us, isn't it?"
Ferb," Well, it is Candace's dream."
Doofenwitch Warlock, It's not witch! It's warlock! Argh! Let me just check my security.
Doofenwitch Warlock,Ooh! Oh! Gross!
Doofenwitch Warlock,"Hey. I know you... you're with that little boot thief, right? Well, I'm going to send out my flying squirrels after her! (sighs) Those stunning little planes, they're cute, but, you know, that they don't fly so fast. We've got some time."
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), How much farther do we have to go?
Candace," All I know is, Phineas and Ferb are behind all this, and if I follow this sidewalk, I will bust them."
Candace,"Wait a minute, I know this. There should be an oil can around here."
Jeremy-Tree, (clears throat) Could you leave the lumberjack alone?
Candace," Jeremy? Forget this! (throws the rusted tin man away, a crash is heard) Oh, hi! I-I couldn't help, but notice that you're, um..."
Jeremy-Tree, A tree?
Candace, A-ttractive.
Jeremy-Tree, It's OK. I know I'm a tree.

Phineas," Hi, Candace. From this point, you have two routes to Bustopolis."
Phineas,On your right is a yellow sidewalk through a terrifying beastbog.
Beastbog, We have saliva!
Phineas," And on your left, Ferb and I have built a frozen non-dairy treat sidewalk through an ice cream canyon. You can skate it and lick it for the ultimate favorable fun."
Nerdcrow and Jeremy-Tree," Ice Cream, ICE CREAM!!!"
Candace," Oh, no, you don't! We're staying on this sidewalk until we meet the wizard and you're busted."
Candace,"Crow, Tree, let's go!"
"Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Jeremy-Tree"," Yes, Candace."
Phineas, Well... there is only one thing left to do.
Phineas, Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Candace," This is better than an ice cream canyon, isn't it?"
Nerdcrow (Baljeet)," Oh, yes, I much prefer rotting vegetation and blood-sucking demons."
Jeremy-Tree, Sure are some scary looking trees in here.
Creepy Tree," Hey, we can't all be movie stars."

Stacy-Owl, Whoo?!
Candace, AHH!
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), What is that?
Jeremy-Tree, Where?
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), There!
Candace, It looks like a lion.

Candace, A blue sidewalk?

Candace," I think you already know my answer. Step it up, freaks!"

Doofenwitch Warlock," Soon those boots will be mine! In the meantime, I'm going to leave you in the capable hands of my spider-monkey, or maybe a monkey-spider. I don't know what he is. Hehehe."
Spider-Monkey," (laughs, then grabs Agent P's fedora; only to get punched by a boxing glove) Owww!"
Candace, Bouncy sidewalk. I'm keeping my eyes on the prize!
Jeremy-Tree," Hey, what's that?"
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), Looks like a squadron of flying squirrels!
All, AHHHH!!!!
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Hey! What are you doin'? Ow, ow, ow! I can't believe I'm doin' this for nothin'!"

Jeremy-Tree," Oh, no. The squirrels have got Candace!"
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), We've got to do something!
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), I got nothin'.
Phineas," Oh, hey, Candace. We're taking the bouncy sidewalk. Of course, your way looks fun, too."
Candace," I'm not having fun, and neither will you if I ever get back to the yellow sidewaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalk!"
Candace,Part II
Candace," Okay. Kidnapped by flying squirrels and stuck in a web that came out of a monkey's butt. Hm. Well, I guess I have had weirder days."
Candace,"There you are, Perry."
Doofenwitch Warlock," Silence! I've got you now, missy. You may as well hand over those boots."
Candace," I would, but they've kind of grown on me."
Doofenwitch Warlock," I know. They're nice, aren't they? And the color really set off your eyes."
Candace," No, really. They've grown on me. I can't take them off."
Doofenwitch Warlock," If I can't take the boots off of you, I have to get you out of the boots, and by that, I mean, disintegrate you entirely!"
Candace," Perry, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Forget about me. Save yourself if you can."
Candace," Well, if it's that easy..."
Doofenwitch Warlock," Ahhh! Get him off of me! Ahh! He could have rabies! ... Oh, I hate spider webs! ... Guards!"
Guard #1, Uh. ... Ready?
Guard #2, Yep.
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Getting our wishes will not be the same without Candace.
Jeremy-Tree," I miss her, too, even if she was a little bossy."
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), I need a firm hand.
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Look! It is Candace's pet platypus. Has he always have that hat?
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), What's he want?
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), Could be rabies.
Major Monogram," Gentlemen, we're out to stop Doofenwitch. You want to rescue the girl. I see an opportunity for some inter-agency cooperation. Now, here's the plan. Wait, why am I a fairy?"
Doofenwitch Warlock," See this hourglass? When this sand runs out, that’s when this big electric timer begins. And when that time runs out, it activates the Brat-Begone-Inator to vaporize you right out of your boots! Haha!"
Doofenwitch Warlock,Ooo! Someone is at my door! (opens door) Hello?
Jeremy-Tree, Hi! You've been selected for a free haunted castle makeover from Witches Brew magazine.
Doofenwitch Warlock, Not witch! Warlock!
Jeremy-Tree, What about the dress?
Doofenwitch Warlock," It's a robe! Whatever, I'm not going to turn down a free makeover. Come on in. I'll show you around."
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," I see you have a bunch of spider webs. Sure, they're classic, but overdone. We say it's more of a modern witch."
Doofenwitch Warlock, Warlock!
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Yeah, whatever."
Candace, Hey! Weren't you taller? ... Perry! Quick! Get me out of here before that whatever -inator zaps me. ... Haha! That tickles! (giggles)
Doofenwitch Warlock, I like it!
Doofenwitch Warlock,Ooh! My Begone-Inator! I'm going to check my crystal ball.
Doofenwitch Warlock,Why did you do that?
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), It's part of the makeover.
Doofenwitch Warlock, Wait a minute! Guards! Again!
Guard #1, Dude.
Guard #2, I'm good.
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), Run for it!
Doofenwitch Warlock, Don't let them escape!
Jeremy-Tree, Candace! Perry!
Doofenwitch Warlock, Ahahaha! How convenient! Everyone's all together.
Jeremy-Tree," Yeah, we're kind of expected in Bustopolis. You know; the Wizard, great and powerful."
Doofenwitch Warlock, Shut up! You're a tree!
Candace, Wait a minute! You can't talk to Jeremy like that!
Doofenwitch Warlock, Put that bucket down!
Candace," Melt, evil witch!"
Doofenwitch Warlock," You little brat! This outfit is 100% cotton. ... Oh, it's shrinking! It's shrinking! I have to go to change my clothes."
Candace," Sorry, I only meant to melt you."
Doofenwitch Warlock, Guards! Dispose of them while I switch into my track suit.
Candace," Dispose of us?!? You... you really don't want to do that, do you?"
Guard," Well, no, but nobody ever asked us what we want to do."
Candace," 'Well, what do you want to do?"
Guard," There's a little number we've been working on. Hit it, boys."

Candace,"Um, hello? I would like speak to the Wizard, please."
Wizard (Linda)," Hello, Candace."
Candace, Mom? You're the Wizard?
Wizard (Linda)," Well, I'm a whiz at the kitchen."
Candace, This time the boys are so busted! Have you seen what they're been up to?
Wizard (Linda)," Up to? Why, no. I..."
Wizard (Linda),"Oops, that's the oven. Boys, could you hand out the gifts while I check on the casserole?"
Phineas," Hey, Candace."
Candace, Phineas? Ferb? But... but... but... but...
Nerdcrow (Baljeet), Does this mean I will not receive coolness?
Phineas," Well, coolness is such a rare and indefinable quality that a few people really have it. Most people wear a pair of these and fake it."
Nerdcrow (Baljeet)," Hey, works for me, chili cheese."
Phineas," Yeah, don't over-sell it. (to Jeremy-Tree) So, Jeremy-Tree. You want to be a real boy instead of a tree, hmm?"
Jeremy-Tree," Well, yeah, but I'll bet you don't have anything in your bag for me."
Phineas," The problem with you is, you're completely delusional."
Jeremy-Tree, I am?
Phineas, Sure. You've been a real boy all along. You're just wearing a tree costume.
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," He's right. There's a zipper right back here. Hey, let me get that off for you. (unzips the tree-suit)"
Jeremy-Tree, (gasps) I'm free!!!... and I'm in my underwear… (Jeremy quickly covers up his underwear)
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Yes. Yes, you are."
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Yes, I want nothing."
Phineas, Some people say they want nothing when really they want something.
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Not really. I'm cool, man."
Phineas, You might want something later.
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford), Nothing!
Phineas, You sure?
Lion-Tiger-Bear Guy (Buford)," Alright! I'll take something! (grabs a sandwich from the bag) Ooo, a ham sandwich. I did want that."
Phineas, And there's one more person with a wish.
Candace, Wait a minute! If you think you could bribe me or something...
Doofenwitch Warlock," I'll get you, my pre... (falls from the ceiling)"
Phineas, And here he is now.
Doofenwitch Warlock, I want...those red rubber boots!
Phineas," Sure. Candace won't mind. Right, Candace?"
Candace," Well, yeah, but they won't come off."
Phineas, Ferb?

Wizard (Linda)," I'm back. Now, what were you're saying, Candace?"
Candace," Mom, you've got to bust Phineas and Ferb!"
Wizard (Linda), Bust them for what?
Candace," Unicorn-pony rides, non-diary frozen treat ice cream ice skating, bouncy sidewalks."
Wizard (Linda)," They sound like fun! Oh, you must have a wonderful time."
Candace, Fun? Are you kidding? I didn't have any fun! I followed the yellow sidewalk like I was told.
Wizard (Linda), Who told you to do that?
Candace, The Good Witch... in the floating eyeball.
Wizard (Linda)," Oh, her. That's what she tells everybody."
"The Good-Witch, Isabella", Take the yellow sidewalk. Take the yellow sidewalk. Take the yellow sidewalk.
Wizard (Linda)," All this time, the boys were only try to show you the fun way to go. The joy is in the journey, you know. (winks)"
Candace," So, you're telling me that I could have fun throughout this entire adventure if only I stepped off the yellow sidewalk and join my doofus brothers? Is that it?"
Wizard (Linda)," On the nosy. Loosen up, sweetheart. Remember to have fun along the way. Summer won't last forever."
Candace, But I want to have fun. I can do it. Really! I'm a fun person!
Wizard (Linda)," Good bye, dear. Mustn't overcook my vegetables."
Candace," Wait! Don't go! I haven't had fun yet! (Starts spinning around in the pink portal from before) Hey, what's happening? No! No! I'm waking up! I don't want to! This isn’t fair! I didn’t have any fun! No! No!"
Phineas," Hi, Candace. (to Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. (to Candace) We just built a self-balancing monster unicycle. It can take us anywhere the fun way. Want to join us?"
Candace, Are you kidding? When I tell Mom what you guys are up to... Did you say fun?
Ferb," Often, the most fun you can be found in your own backyard."
Candace, And the joy...is in the journey... Okay! I'm in!
Phineas, Cool!
Candace," Oh, Jeremy! Hi! Let's go!"
Jeremy," More fun than taking the sidewalk, huh, Candace?"
Candace, You have no idea.
Phineas," (From the back of the screen) Have fun, everybody!"
