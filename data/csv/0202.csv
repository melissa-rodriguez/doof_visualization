Phineas," What to do, what to do, what to do today. Any ideas, Ferb?"
Phineas," What about you, Perry? Bursting with any plans?"
Phineas, Ah. I'll never get tired of you doing that.
Phineas," Awesome. (Chatters) Come on, Ferb. Fire one off."
Ferb, (Chatters)
Phineas, I wonder what that means.
Phineas," Hey, Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today! Let's build a Perry translator. We can finally figure out what (Chatters) means. Some say he's just a mindless platypus, but he might actually be thinking some profound thoughts. Just like another quiet animal I know."
Candace," Stacy, it's been four days. (Rolls her chair to a picture referencing Cinderella. The faces are replaced with Candace and Jeremy's faces) I'm not expecting Prince Charming to bring me a glass slipper or anything, but a phone call would be nice. (Phone beeping) Hold on, I've got another call. (Gasps) (Holds up the phone, showing a heart with Jeremy's face in it) It's him! Call you back! Bye! (Phone beeps) Hello?"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. It's Jeremy."
Candace," Well, good morrow to you, sir."
Jeremy, Huh?
Candace," (Chuckles) I mean, what's up?"
Jeremy, I just got the new Destruction Mayhem 3 game. I thought maybe you'd like to come over and try it out.
Candace," (Sarcastically) Oh, yeah, you, me, and little Suzy playing a video game, huh?"
Jeremy," Suzy? No. She's at her friend's house. (The door knocks and he pauses the game) Uh, hold on, Candace. Someone's at the door. (Opens the door)"
Candace," (Panting) So, video games?"
Phineas, All set over here!
Phineas, Okay. Now all we need is our subject. Where's Perry?
Major Monogram," Ah, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the lights. We're using an alternative energy source, and haven't got it working smoothly yet. I decided it was high time our operation went green. All right, assignment, assignment. Oh, let's see... We're saving paper by printing on the same one over and over again, so... Uh, sorry for the life on me. (Turns the paper, showing black ink all over it) I can't make this out. Hmm... Well, I'm sure it says something about Doofenshmirtz. Go get him!"
Major Monogram," (Gets up and walks off-screen) For crying out loud, Carl, (Carl is seen pedaling the generator, panting) pedal faster. I gotta check my E-mail."
Phineas," Perry! (Perry switches to pet mode. Phineas walks on-screen) Oh, there you are. Come on, boy. Here, just take a seat. (Puts him on a stool) Stay. All set."
Phineas," (Holding up a mic) Okay, Perry. It's time to hear what's on your mind. Hit me with your (Chatters) shot."
Isabella," Hey, Phineas! What'cha dooooin'?"
Phineas, Oh. Ferb and I invented a Perry translator so we can finally figure out what he's saying.
Isabella, That's great. (Her face becomes sheepish) But don't you need Perry to be here for it to work?
Phineas," (Turns his head, noticing Perry is gone) That was weird. Perry was here a second ago."
Translator," I sure love worms. (Phineas and Ferb hear this and turn to Isabella, thinking she said that)"
Isabella, Don't look at me.
Translator," Big, fat, juicy worms!"
Translator," Gotta find 'em, gotta eat 'em!"
Phineas and Isabella, Whoa.
Phineas," Hello, birdie. Do you understand me?"
Translator, Aren't you a little young for inter-speciel communication?
Phineas," Yes. Yes I am. How about you, squirrel? Do you understand me? (Points the mic at the squirrel)"
Translator," Oh, I do. Do you have any nuts for me?"
Isabella, That's so cute.
Squirrel, (Squeaks)
Translator," Yeah yeah yeah, I'm cute. I'm cute. Now, nut me."
Phineas, Wow. This works on all animals.
Isabella," Hey, do you think it would work on my dog, Pinky? He barks at the door when a doorbell rings on TV. I'd love to explain the whole concept to him."
Phineas, Couldn't hurt to try.
Isabella, (Runs off) Great! I'll be right back.
Phineas," Wow! With a device like this, all animals can finally say what's on their minds."
Jeremy," I'm really glad you wanted to come over, Candace. Most girls really aren't into stuff like this."
Candace," Pssh. Most girls. I guess I'm just cool like that. Yup, love me my video games. (A poodle pops up) Who's this?"
Jeremy," Yeah, that's Suzy's dog. (Rubs her head) Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl? Yeah."
Candace, Yeah. Who's the good girl? Who's the good girl?
Candace," Obviously, not me."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus? Don't be shy, It's just me. Come here. (A cage falls) (Laughs) You like my new cage? I got it from a second-hand shark supply store. It was half off, because you know, something bit half of it off. So, here's my evil plan: With this remote, I will open the Danville Dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways! Like the canals in Venice, Italy! (Italian music plays) Or to a lesser extent, Venice, California. (Surf rock music plays) But how will people get around? They will have to buy my latest invention! It's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water. (Pulls the tarp) Behold! You like it? I call it the Buoyancy Operated Aquatic Transport, or BO-AT for short. Everyone will want one."
Phineas," Yeah, I see what you're saying, but you don't have an argument. They're giving you 12 cans a day. Technically, you're not underfed. All right, next!"
Phineas, Oh yeah. I've been getting a lot of complaints about the vacuum. Just let it out.
Candace," Hey, look at this. I'm getting the hang of it. (Game beeping)"
Jeremy," No, actually Candace, you just paused it. (Game sounds) And now you've reset the game."
Candace, (Gasps) Oh no. These we're brand new.
Jeremy," Hey, bad dog! That's weird. Suzy trained her so well."
Candace, (Suspiciously) I see. Suzy trained her.
Candace,"I can't believe this. Hey, that's my shoe!"
Jeremy," Uh, okay in there, Candace?"
Candace," Yeah, yeah. (at poodle) (Gasps) Don't even think about it! (Gasps, throws paper towels into toilet)"
Poodle, (Drops shoe)
Candace," Where's my shoe? No, no, no! (Grunting)"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. Ready for the third level? (Door slams) Candace?"
Isabella, Phineas?
Phineas, What's up?
Isabella," Okay. We've got 78 complaints about food quantity, 42 requests for belly rubs, and we're still trying to explain TV to Pinky."
Milly," Again, forget the idea of little people in there."
Isabella," So, what exactly are we supposed to do with this information?"
Phineas, Hmm...
Ginger, Okay. The Jones's hamster is gonna lose it if someone doesn't oil the wheel in its cage.
Hamster, Hmph!
Ginger," Well, what now?"
Phineas," That's what we'll do. Let's tell all the owners what their pets want! Starting with this little fella right here. (hamster squeaks) Sorry. Lady. Lady right here. (at Candace) Hey, Candace!"
Candace, What is going on here?
Phineas," We made an animal translator! We'll tell you all about it later. Right now we're on a mission. Come on, guys."
Isabella," See ya, Candace!"
Candace," An animal translator? I have had it up to HERE with stupid animals today! Why would you wanna know what stupid animals are saying? Oh, I can tell you what they'll say: ""I'm an animal and I bite my own heinie!"" ""I've got a small cranial capacity!"" ""Look at me! I don't have opposable thumbs!"" (The animals start to become angry at Candace's statements and begin growling at her) ""I eat with my face!"" ""I sweat through my tongue!"" ""I'm a furry-flea bitten loser! LIKE ANY OTHER ANIMAL ON THIS PLANET!"""
Doberman, (barks into mic)
Translator, Get her!
Candace, (screams)
Band members, Oof! (Groaning)
Doofenshmirtz," Now, Perry the Platypus, with a push of this button, we will move out of the automobile age, and USHER IN THE AGE OF THE BO-AT! I'm driving on water! Look at me! I'm BO-AT-ing! Woo-hoo! Living the dream! Perry the Platypus? How did-- I always forget you are a semi-aquatic mammal. (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face)"
Candace, MOM! MOM! ANIMALS HATE ME!
Linda," Oh, honey. That's just ridiculous. Perry likes you."
Candace, (sighs) Huh. Huh. Never mind.
Doofenshmirtz, Aah!
Doofenshmirtz," No! Don't open the Metropolitan Oval Aquatic Trench! (moat opens up) No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, look! It spells ""MOAT"". I never noticed that before. Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Candace," Mom! You're here! Come on, come on! You gotta see this!"
Linda," Candace, will you--"
Candace, Aha! (gasps) I can't believe it. Everything is still here. There it is! They built an animal translator!
Linda," Oh, that's adorable."
Candace," Wait. No, it is not!"
Phineas," Hey, Mom. We built an animal translator. Look!"
Candace, See? You're gonna see. It really works! Heeheeheeheehee.
Phineas," Okay, Perry. We've been waiting all day for this."
Translator, (plays back Perry's chatter)
Phineas," Oh, well. I guess it doesn't mean anything."
Linda," Aw, you know he's saying, ""You guys are the best!"" Now, come on everyone. Inside for some lemonade."
Candace, Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but... (sighs)
Jeremy," Hey, Candace."
Candace, Jeremy?
Jeremy," Hey, where'd you go?"
Candace," Well, I-"
Jeremy, I brought you your shoe.
Candace, Oh.
Jeremy," Oh, don't worry. I washed it. Here. Allow me."
Jeremy," Uh, Candace? You 'kay?"
Candace, (Sighs) Enchanted.
