,Shimmy Jimmy
Announcer, Another gem from the Har D Har toy makers!
Hyena, Ha Ha Ha Ha!
Store Manager," There, you see? It sells itself. Shimmy Jimmy is our number one toy! I hope you are ready to face some costumers, Candace."
Candace, (winks) You can depend on me.
Candace," Hi, Stacy. Yeah, it's so cool. The first day of my first job, and the best part is Jeremy works across the aisle! I can watch him make hot dogs all day. Any moment now Jeremy will look over and notice how cute I look."
Store Manager," (offscreen) Candace, you're not wearing your Shimmy Jimmy hat! (slams said hat onto Candace's head)"
Jeremy, Candace? Is that you?
Candace, (screams)
Store Manager," Candace, look! (Cut to the door where Phineas, Ferb and Linda wave. He continues offscreen) You have your first customers! (Cut back to him, he pushes Candace towards them) Oh, and don't forget to do the laugh! Go on!"
Candace," (walks up to them, no nonsense) Welcome to the Har D Har toy store. Ha ha ha ha."
Linda," Oh, honey. I'm so proud of you. I'm just going to leave the boys here to browse while I make some exchanges. Back in a bit, working girl."
Phineas, Could we hear the laugh again?
Candace," Don't bug me, you insects."
Store Manager, (clears his throat) Candace?
Candace," (sarcastically) Let me introduce to you boys to Shimmy Jimmy, the must have toy of the century. It's totally awesome."
Phineas, Seems like that would get old really quick.
Candace, (sarcastically) Like you geniuses can make a better toy.
Phineas, I know what we're doing today.
Phineas," (while writing on a notepad) Okay, then, what we need is a toy so stupidly simple, (drilling) so basically bland, (jack hammering) so idiotically uncomplicated... (splattering; Perry walks away) that it can do absolutely anything. (flames whoosh) Hmm. Say, where's Perry?"
Ferb, (whistles)
Phineas, What did you got?
Major Monogram," Ah, there you are, Agent P. We suspect your nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, has been pilfering bricks from buildings across the Tri-State Area. Animals are rioting, convicts are escaping from the zoo. It's chaos. You've got to stop him, Perry, (Perry salutes) before it all falls down."
Board Member #1," As you can see, our sales have plummeted. Kids just aren't interested in climby toys anymore."
Board Member #2," Yeah, but we've always made climby toys. I mean, who could forget Climbin' Simon? Or what about Ascendin' Brendan? And then of course, there's Ladderman Larry. Or the classic Climby Jaimie?"
Board Member #1, Stop it! What we need is a fresh new toy!
Phineas," Greetings, movers and shakers. I'm Phineas and that's Ferb. We have the toy for you."
J.B., Hold on there. Aren't you a bit young to be toy designers?
Phineas," Well...I don't think so. (pauses) And now, it's fresh, it's new, it's incredibly hip. Soon to be the biggest hit of the new toy season,"
Phineas, Perry the Platypus.
Board Member #2, Uh...what does it do?
Phineas, That's the beauty part. It does absolutely nothing! Now it can be anything we want! Like an airplane...or a race car...or maybe a bucking bronco. It can even turn a mean Tango.
J.B.," Just a minute. We could promise the moon without really promising anything. (pauses, then chuckles) I love it!"
Board Member #1," What, are you all crazy? It's just...a stupid block of wood and it doesn't...do anything!"
Marketing Employee, I love it. What are we talking about?
J.B.," Glad we're on the same page. Phineas and Ferb, we're gonna mass=produce your toy that does nothing. I'll put both of you in charge, and double your salaries. What'd you say?"
Phineas," Actually, we've never made a salary."
J.B.," Well, then, I'll triple it."
J.B.," Here's the factory, boys. This is where it all happen."
Phineas, Wow. Somehow I never pictured a toy factory being this boring. (pauses) Time for a makeover...
Marketing Employee," Boys, got an angle on our new toy you are gonna love. (reveals poster #1; Perry dressed as a super hero) Perry the Atomic Super Platypus!"
Phineas, He's just a platypus.
Marketing Employee, Right. Got it. Just a platypus.
Marketing Employee, You're gonna flip for this. Are you ready for... (reveals poster #2) ...The Mad Marauding Marsupial of Death?
Phineas, He's just a platypus.
Worker #1, I don't get why we have to wear these silly outfits.
Worker #2, I like it. It gives me purpose.
Phineas, Huh? This is a toy factory. How did this chocolate river get here? Who the heck are you guys?
The Ba-dink-a-dinks, We are the Ba-dink-a-dinks!
A Ba-dink-a-dink," You set us free when you remodeled the factory. We'd been trapped in the basement for years, making foam peanuts and snipping the tabs off of plastic."
The Ba-dink-a-dinks, We will now lay waste to the surface dwellers!
Phineas," Okay, then. Carry on."
Marketing Employee, This one is dynamite. (reveals poster #3; Perry in secret agent mode) Secret Agent Perry the Platypus. Huh?
Phineas, You have anything else?
Marketing Employee," Um, no, no I don't."
Marketing Employee," (reveals poster #4, which Ferb gave to him) ""Perry the Platypus Inaction Figure. It does...nothing""?"
Phineas, (as balloons and confetti falls) That's it!
Doofenshmirtz," Well, if it isn’t Perry the Platypus. You've arrived precisely on cue. Allow me to explain. Voila! (removes a cover, revealing a replica of the Tri-State Area) A precise 1/100th scale replica of the Tri-State Area! You'd be surprised how much free time I have. Now, with all the bricks that I've... eh...collected, I'll construct the Great Wall of the Tri-State Area, thereby cutting off the citizens from the rest of the world. (chuckles) How do people get in and out the city, you ask? With this official Doofenshmirtz-approved toll booth. I...haven't really worked out a price point yet, but it won't be cheap, I can tell you that."
Boy, I want a green one.
Store Manager," Here you go, little angel."
Boy, Yay! My own Inaction Figure!
Store Manager," Candace, come on out."
Candace," (wearing a platypus suit) You're kidding, right?"
Store Manager, Fantastic! You look like number 1.
Candace, I feel like number 2.
Store Manager," That's the spirit! Now, go out there and bring us some customers."
Candace," Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'm just so glad that Jeremy's on break. If he saw me in this thing, I think I'd plotz."
Jeremy," Excuse me, sir? (pauses) Oh, Candace? Wow, in that outfit, I couldn't even tell you're a girl."
Candace, (laughs weakly)
Jeremy," See you later, Candace."
Candace, This isn't worth $3.50 an hour.
TV Reporter," I'm here live with Phineas and Ferb, creators of the international toy phenomena, Perry the Platypus Inaction Figure."
Announcer, Exotic backgrounds not included.
TV Reporter, Simply amazing! (at the boys) What was your inspiration?
Phineas," Well, we have a pet platypus named Perry. (at Candace) Oh, hi, Candace. Nice suit. (to the TV reporter) Now, as I was saying, he's a platypus. He doesn't do much."
Candace, I should've known those two were behind this! (pulls out her cell phone) Time to call Mom!
Linda," What is it, Candace?"
Linda," Okay, Candace. Calm down. I'll come by and see you as soon as I'm done with the exchanges."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus? How did you escape? Probably should have used cement. Ah, no matter. You’ll never catch me. (laughs)"
Doofenshmirtz," (chuckles) You can't stop me, Perry the Platypus! You can't stop me with a million Perry the Platypuses, because I'm unstoppable! (screams)"
Doofenshmirtz," Ha, ha! Finally! I lost you, Perry the Platypus! I’m free of you! (notices the inaction figures, then screams) Get him off of me! Get him off of me! Get him off of me!"
Worker #1," So, did you see the game on Saturday?"
Worker #2," Yeah, a real nail biter."
Doofenshmirtz," Shoo, shoo! Go away! .... Wow, that was just disturbing. Wah! No, no! Get away from me! (falls into a box)"
Phineas," So, Ferb,"
Phineas, I think the sale projections are...
Phineas," Hey, people, (picks Perry up) I thought we agreed we weren't gonna do this. (tosses Perry over his shoulder) How many times do I have to say it? (Perry lands in a dumpster with all the rejections) He's a platypus. They don't do anything."
Doofenshmirtz," (trapped in one of the boxes) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, wait! Where are we going? Is that sea water I smell? I hope I'm not on a boat, 'cause I get sea sick."
J.B.," So, how does everyone likes my new suit?"
Ferb," Um, that man isn't wearing any clothes."
J.B.," There you are, Phineas and what's-his-name. Perry the Platypus is a smashing hit! So, what's your next big idea?"
Phineas, We're going home.
J.B., But .why? You're top of your game. You've got your whole career ahead of you.
Phineas," It's supper time. Mom's makin' fried chicken, but thanks for a great day."
J.B.," Oh, that's just great. Any of the rest of you geniuses have an idea?"
Marketing Employee," I found this in my office with a pile of shattered glass, J.B."
J.B., What's this? A brick? (pauses) That's brilliant!
Phineas," Now, who would buy a brick for a toy?"
Ferb, It does absolutely nothing!.
