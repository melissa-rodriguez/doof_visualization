Linda," Hey boys, want some fat-free whole-grain granola bars? They're still warm from the oven."
Phineas, Whole-grain and fat-free? (He and Ferb take a granola bar) You know us so well.
Linda," (Walks off) Yes, yes I do."
Phineas," You know, Mom's always doing nice things for us. I think it's time we did something nice for Mom! Let's see... We could—No..."
Phineas, Or—Uh uh.
Phineas, Huh...
Isabella," Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?"
Phineas, We're trying to think of a nice thing we can do for Mom. Any ideas?
Isabella, You can clean up the whole house for her!
Baljeet," Or, you can get a classic wooden slide rule from Analog Emporium."
Buford," How do I know what adults like? What am I, a computer?"
Phineas, That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make a super computer!
Buford, What? Your Mom wants a super computer? What is she? Some kind of nerd?
Phineas," No, we're gonna ask the computer what to do for Mom."
Baljeet, Slide rule! I gave it to you on a silver platter!
Linda," Okay, I'm going out. (Pulls out a coupon) I've got a coupon for a free hair styling from this new salon. I'm gonna freshen up my look. Granola bars are in the kitchen! (walks away)"
Candace," Ugh. Maybe I'll feed mine to Perry. Hey, where is Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. The entire Tri-State Area's becoming riddled with holes. Also, numerous light beams have been shot from Doofenshmirtz's building. Either he's having some sort of a rave, or he's the one behind all those holes. Investigate at once! (Salutes) Good luck, Agent P!"
Supercomputer, And that's the story of how you made me.
Isabella, He's cute!
Doofenshmirtz, (Repeatedly firing his ray) That's not it... That's not it...
Doofenshmirtz, That's not it... (Picks up an item) That is not it.
Doofenshmirtz, That's not it.
Doofenshmirtz," (Laughs) Welcome, Perry the Platypus. How do you like your trap? That's super quick drying cement. See? (Knocks on the cement) Solid as a, uh... I dunno, some rock-like substance. Cement, maybe! Now, with you safely trapped, I introduce you to the Metal-Unearth-inator! (The Metal-Unearth-inator fires, and a can comes back)"
Phineas," All right, gang, It's ready to go. We just need to perform an initial scan of the Tri-State Area so it has enough data to work with."
Supercomputer, Scanning the Tri-State-Area.
Boy," Between that and the random laser drills, this is like the second best mid-day scrapyard rave ever!"
Doctor," (Preparing to activate a CT scanner) Hold still and... (The red scan light flashes, showing her skeleton. She pulls out her cell phone) Hello, Hospital Workers Union."
Norm, Get out of my mind!
Supercomputer," Gathering data from all objects and habitants. Computing all logical outcome of all events. (Finishes scanning, bell dings) Done."
Phineas," Okay, computer. Are you ready to answer any question?"
Supercomputer," Yes, my data is complete. My logic, infallible."
Phineas, What's 2 + 2?
Supercomputer, 4. Perhaps you should just count on your fingers.
Phineas," Sorry. What's the square root of 72,361?"
Supercomputer, 269. Try something more unusual.
Isabella, What are the names the girls in my Fireside Girls troop?
Supercomputer," Gretchen, Adyson, Holly, Katie, Milly, and Ginger."
Isabella," Wow, he's good!"
Baljeet," On a multi-valve engine with variable timing, how can I isolate an exhaust valve leak at the stem seal without removing the can shaft?"
Supercomputer, Coat the engine with tomato paste and the leak will reveal itself.
Buford," He's right! Uh, what size pants do I wear?"
Supercomputer," Boys, husky, extra large."
Baljeet, He's right!
Buford, Impressive! (Thumbs up)
Phineas," Well, you seem to be working perfectly so, computer, what is the nicest thing we can do for Mom today?"
Supercomputer," Computing... (Ding) Done. Get a gallon of industrial marking dye and a leaf blower. Tie balloons onto them. Then, go to the top of Danville Hill, and at 2:37 p.m., release them into the wind."
Phineas, Really?
Supercomputer, Nothing would make your mother happier today.
Baljeet, You turned that slide rule for this?
Phineas," I don't know, Baljeet. From what we seen so far, I think a little blind faith is called for."
Baljeet, You know nothing about women.
Buford," Dude, it's over."
Candace," Okay, there must be something bustable going on around here. (Notices the super computer. She drops her phone) What...is..that?"
Supercomputer, I am a super computer. I can answer any question that you can possibly ask.
Candace, Did my brothers make you?
Supercomputer," Yes. Yes, they did."
Candace," Okay. So, let me think of a question... Hmm... How many states in the United States?"
Supercomputer, 50.
Candace, What goes on top of pancakes?
Supercomputer, Butter and syrup.
Candace," How do you pronounce the ""J"" in ""Jalapeño""?"
Supercomputer," It makes the ""H"" sound."
Candace, (Hisses) I knew that. How many fingers behind my back?
Supercomputer, Two.
Candace," Okay, that's just freaky. And...bustable! All I gotta do is... (Pause) But it never works! No matter what I try, whatever the boys do just disappears before Mom looks! If only there was some way to guarantee Mom would see what the boys done? (Looks at the supercomputer) Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee..."
Doofenshmirtz," What? Another one? Why are there so many helmets buried in the Tri-State Area? (Tosses it off) Ah, onto the pile you go."
Doofenshmirtz," So, Perry the Platypus, hope you didn't come here because of the holes, because the Metal-Unearth-inator is not even my final plan. May I present to you my real plan? The All-Purpose-inator! You heard of a man's man? Well, this is an inator's inator. (His hand is seen on the control panel) It does everything! (Takes his hand off the control panel) Of course, once I activate it, it will make all my inators obsolete, but, uh... I guess that's progress. Unfortunately, I ran into a little snag..."
Doofenshmirtz," After putting all the final touches on my All-Purpose-inator, I took a step back to admire my handiwork. Victory was finally within my grasp."
Doofenshmirtz, All I needed to do is turn the thing on. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz pulls out a key) Then fate made a cruel joke. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz slips on green paint. The key falls off the balcony) The ignition key fell of my balcony!
Flashback Doofenshmirtz," Nooooooo!!!!! (With binoculars, he spots a gopher take the key and run into its hole)"
Doofenshmirtz," I could tell he was laughing. You know, that way gophers do. And there's no way I was going to go all the way down there to get the key. I've got a schedule to keep."
Doofenshmirtz," So, I decided to build the Metal-Unearth-inator to track down and dig up the key so I can fire up my All-Purpose-inator..."
Candace," But then, when I bring Mom into the backyard, it's gone and Mom never sees it. So here's my question, Mr. Supercomputer, how can I get my Mom to see what my brothers have done?"
Supercomputer, Elementary. You must build a device that makes your Mom see what your brothers have done.
Candace, What kind of device?
Supercomputer," Follow my instructions to the letter and when you have finished, I am 100% certain that your Mom will see what your brothers have done."
Candace, Okay. Where do I start? (pulls out a notepad and a pencil)
Supercomputer," (while Candace is writing) You are going to need a toaster, a number two screwdriver, some electrical tape..."
Doofenshmirtz," Helmet, helmet, another helmet. What happened here?"
Doofenshmirtz,"A chisel? (picks it up) Well, it's no key but at least we're getting closer in size. (tosses it over his shoulder)"
Doofenshmirtz,"A hammer? Why would someone bury a hammer? Well, onto the pile you go. (tosses the hammer)"
Doofenshmirtz," I'm closing in on the key. I can feel it. (gasps) Perry the Platypus, how did you get out?"
Doofenshmirtz," (gasps again) Well, two can play at that game."
Doofenshmirtz," (chuckles; awkward silence) Uh, wait a second. Hold on. (rummages in the pile) Not this, not this. There was a whole bunch of 'em just a couple of minutes ago. A-ha! Jackpot!"
Doofenshmirtz," Now, Perry the Platypus, meet your doom. (screams)"
Phineas," Keep up, Buford, it's almost 2:37."
Buford," Hey, I don't have balloons to lighten my load."
Baljeet, I would have walked.
All," Three, two, one... (Phineas and Ferb releases the items into the air) Liftoff!"
Phineas, There they go. Industrial orange marker dye and a leaf blower. Guaranteed happiness for Mom. Somehow. Let's follow and see what happens.
Phineas," This way, everybody."
Baljeet," Sure, now you put me down."
Candace," There, finished. Did I put it together right?"
Supercomputer," You built it perfectly, Candace. Your Mom will definitely see what the boys have done. And you finished it just in time, because in two seconds your Mom is going to pull up."
Candace, Wow! You're right about everything! (runs off) I can't lose! (to Linda) Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mo...
Linda, I'm having a bad day.
Candace," Uh, never mind. Come on, come on, come on. (pushes Linda towards the backyard)"
Doofenshmirtz," So, no so tough without your mace. (Perry glares at him) Now, I have the upper hand. (Perry takes off the helmet) Prepare to meet your doom... (He holds up the shield after Perry throws it at him.) You throw your helmet at me? That's so lame, Perry the... (Perry starts throwing helmets at him.) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Supercomputer, Precisely on schedule.
Supercomputer, Hello gopher! (the wiring detaches from it)
Candace, (pushes Linda into the backyard with eyes closed) It's over here! It's over here! See?
Phineas," Hi, Candace!"
Linda," You know, Candace (turns around) most days, this is just a little disturbing. But today, with the free coupon (camera pans up) and this whole awful thing with my hair..."
Supercomputer, And the gopher lets go now.
Linda, (with eyes closed) If only I had...
Linda, (groans)
Linda, (opens her eyes; looks in the hand mirror) Huh?
Linda, My hair looks so...cute! I guess it just needed some time to settle. (walks away)
Candace," But, but, but, buuuuuu..."
Linda," It's so great when something nice happens to you, especially when you weren't expecting it. (exits)"
Candace, What just happened?
Phineas, We did something nice for Mom. We fixed her bad hairdo. Apparently.
Candace, You did that?
Phineas, Yup.
Candace, You... did that?
Phineas, That's right. With a little supercomputer help.
Candace," So, when Mom looked in the mirror on that thing I built, she saw what you had done?"
Phineas, That's right.
Ferb," And by the way, nice use of the accordion arm."
Candace, Oh! I hate computers! (exits)
Phineas," Hey, where'd the computer go?"
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh! The key detection alarm! I forgot I installed that. (tosses the sword and shield) Here it comes,..."
Supercomputer, I knew this was going to happen.
Doofemshmirtz, Uh-oh.
Doofemshmirtz,"Well, at least I found the key to the..."
Doofemshmirtz,"Nice! Curse you, Perry the..."
Doofemshmirtz,"Yeah, I knew that was gonna happen."
