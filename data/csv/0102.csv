DJ," This is Stanky Dog comin' to you on the hottest of the summer! Unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothin' today. Yup, just find yourself a shady tree, and maybe an aquatic mammal of some sort, and blow the whole day off."
Phineas," Come on, Ferb. If we let a little heat stop us from having the best day ever, then the morning DJs win."
Linda," Ooh! Boy, it's hot today. So what are you up to?"
Phineas," We're making our own beach, right here in the backyard."
Linda," Oh, how cute. Well, I'm off to my spa day. You boys behave yourselves and don't bother your father. He's finally cleaning out the basement."
Candace," Bye, Mom! Yes! You heard her. We can't bug dad which makes me in charge...by default. (pauses) Carry on."
Phineas," We're gonna need more sand. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. Lawn gnomes across the Tri-State Area are disappearing, leaving thousands of gardens unprotected from the evils of black magic. We suspect Doofenshmirtz. Get right on it."
Delivery Guy, Aren't you a little young to be a landscape contractor?
Phineas," Yes. Yes, I am."
Isabella," Hi, Phineas."
Phineas," Oh, hey, Isabella."
Isabella, Whatcha doin'?
Phineas, Building a beach. Check it out.
Isabella, Can me and the Fireside girls be lifeguards? We need to earn our Aquatic-Safety badges.
Phineas, Sure.
Candace," I mean, I've been a friend of Suzy's longer than Katie's, so I should've been invited to that party first. I don't care if they're lab partners! We're locker neighbors. And locker neighbors trumps lab partners any day. (Gasps) Sorry, Stacy. Gotta go."
Phineas, Welcome to our beach.
Candace," Hah! You call that a beach? This is way below your usual standard. This isn't even worth a call to Mom. You know, if you guys ever want to be popular, you're gonna have to stop playing in sandboxes. (Gets hit by a beach ball) Hey!"
Phineas," So Candace, what do you think?"
Candace, That's it! I'm calling Mom.
Stacy," Hey, Candace."
Candace, Jenny? Stacy?
Jenny, You never told us you have a beach in your backyard!
Stacy, You're going to be the most popular girl in the neighborhood.
Candace, I will?
Stacy, I just saw Jeremy and his buddies with their surf boards.
Candace, Jeremy's here? (Panting) Gotta go!
Doofenshmirtz," (chuckles) Yes, yes! Just look at the bounty of gnome riches! Oh, this is a strange one. Wait, who are you? ... A platypus? ... Perry the Platypus?! You are mine now! (Presses button, garage door opens) Oh no, wait, wait, wait. That was the garage door opener. You are mine now! (Presses button, large monitor activates) And that was the TV remote. I've got to start labeling these things. A-ha! You are mine now! (Laughs maniacally) Finally, I will rid myself of you! (brings out another control) But first, turn your attention to the giant screen and... (the garage door closes) Hmm, maybe I need to turn the cable on first."
Phineas, Let's get this beach party started!
Phineas," Hey, look! I can see our house from up here!"
Candace," (Coconut falls) Oh... (Falls on crab, Groaning)"
Crowd, How low can you go? How low can you go? 
Man,
Candace, What? What's everybody looking at?
Man," For winning the limbo contest, you are now officially crowned Queen Wahini of the beach! All hail Queen Wahini!"
Candace, (overjoyed) I can't believe it!
Ferb, ♪ Listen up people and I'll teach ya ♪
Ferb,"We got the backyard beach, a backyard beach ♪"
Candace, I've never been happier in my entire life!
Linda," Something is very wrong. Not a single call from Candace, not even a text message. Oga, hose me down. I'm going home."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I think I finally got the right one. Now, Perry the Platypus, you will finally understand my pain."
Mr. Doofenshmirtz," Bewege dich nicht! (""Don't move!"")"
Doofenshmirtz," While the other children played Kick-the-Schtumpel and eat Doonkelberries, I would stand for hours."
Mr. Doofenshmirtz," Bewege dich nicht! (""Don't move!"")"
Doofenshmirtz," All through the cold night as the Spitzenhounds howled, my only companion was the moon. And my neighbor Kenny."
Mr. Doofenshmirtz," Bewege dich nicht! (""Don't move!"")"
Doofenshmirtz," And since my lawn gnome was taken away from me, I will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire Tri-State Area! Behold, the Destruct-inator! And now, Perry the Platypus, to activate my creation! (pushes a button and opens Perry's trap) Nooooo!"
DJ, Surf contest!
Buford," Out of my way, Dinner-bell."
Phineas," Hello, Buford. Perhaps you missed the sign."
Buford," (reads the sign) ""No Bullying, No Yodeling""?"
Man, (Austrian accent) I don't like this any more than you do.
Stanky Dog," First up in the surf contest is Bobby Nelson. Oh! And Nelson eats it on five-footer! And there's Django Brown shooting the curl, and here comes Buford Van Stomm! Ohh! He pummels Brown with a Philadelphia traffic stomp! And now he's got him in a Half-Nelson, now a Full-Nelson, oh! And now he's actually beating him with Bobby Nelson! Here's the scores from our judges. And Buford doesn't like it one bit. (Buford smashes the table with Bobby) Next up is Phineas Flynn, and it's great to see a young surfer show such confidence. Uh-oh, what's this? (Buford splashes through the holographic Phineas) Oh, those kids today and their holographic projections. He's in the pipeline, now he's hangin' ten! He's hanging twenty! He's hangin' thirty-two! Now he's just hangin'! The crowd loves it! I don't think there's a name for that! The crowd is doing the wave, and Phineas is surfing it! Let's go to the judges.10 to the 5th power, infinity, and oh! It seems Phineas Flynn's radical surfing has made judge #3 re-think Einstein's theory of relativity! Cowabunga, laws of nature!"
Candace," So, are you having fun?"
Candace," Eee... (Cell phone rings) ...just one second. (dreamily, on phone) Hello--?"
Linda," Uh, Candace? Is everything okay?"
Candace," (dreamily)Ohh, everything is just wonderful."
Linda, And...Phineas and Ferb? What are they doing?
Candace," (dreamily) Ohh, such wonderful things."
Linda," Candace, honey, I'm coming home. (needle scratches)"
Candace," Wait, what?"
Linda, (On phone) I'm right around the corner; I'll be there in two minutes.
Candace," Wait! No mom, you can't! (Linda turns off the phone) Oh, wait, wait! Uhh... (at Jeremy) Stay right there! (runs off) I've got to stop her! Oh, no, no, no, no. (Linda arrives) Mom, Mom, plee-ase, Mom! Go away! Don't come in!"
Isabella, Is that a volcano?
Stanky Dog, Gnomes...! (Gnome hits him) Oof!
Man, Run for your lives! It's gnome-ageddon!
Man #2, Who's protecting our gardens?
Linda," Candace, tell me the truth. What is going on here?"
Candace," (Sighs, talking fast) Phineas and Ferb built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to. But instead of just a cute little beach in a sandbox; it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline, and palm trees, and a pier, and hula dancers, and water skiers, and tiki huts, and dolphins, and dancing, and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up-"
Doofenshmirtz, Oof!
Candace," ...and then I was just about to share a smoothie with Jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head, and-...and just for a moment, it seemed that the wily Buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes- ...then I can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom! If you would just let me have my moment?"
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry."
Phineas,"Well, everybody, looks like that's all for today!                "
Crowd, Phineas and Ferb! (X3)
Candace," If you don't believe me, go see for yourself."
Phineas, That was great.
Linda," Hey, boys."
Phineas," Hey, Mom."
Linda, So how was your day at the beach?
Candace," Wait, wait, my kingdom, my Jeremy, it was all so beautiful...! (panics) WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY PARADISE?!"
Linda," Candace, honey, I think it's time to get you out of the sun for a little while. (leaves)"
Phineas, I think she had fun.
DJ," Stanky Dog here with a special shout-out to my two new pals, Phineas and Ferb, for hosting a beach party that was hot, hot, hot. And speaking of hot, slather on the sunscreen listeners, cause tomorrow's weather calls for another scorcher."
Ferb, With a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes.
