Phineas," You know, Ferb, one of the best times we ever had was when we built that roller coaster. (pauses) We should do it again! But this time...as a musical! What did you say? We'll do all the same things, except we'll break into spontaneous singing and choreography with no discernible music source!"
Ferb, Hmm...what assurance would we have that everyone else will also break into song and do the same thing?
Phineas, I don't know. I think they probably will.
Ferb, Fair enough. I'm in.

Linda," Phineas, Ferb! I'm gonna go pick up a few things. You boys stay out of trouble, okay?"
Phineas," Okay, Mom."
Candace," I'm in charge, right? You did tell them I'm in charge."
Linda," Relax, Candace. Nobody has to be in charge."
Candace, But what if there's an emergency?
Linda, Like what?
Candace," What if, uh... What if a wild moose, a whole herd of them, burst into the house and attack everyone?"
Linda," If that happens, you're in charge."
Candace, Yes.
Candace, Mom says I'm in charge...conditionally.
Phineas," The condition didn't have anything to do with a moose, did it?"
Candace, You know it's funny you should mention that oh! (Realizing she is getting distracted) I'm watching you.
Candace," Hello? Oh, hi, Stacy! Mom just went to the store, she left me charge, well, you know, conditionally."
Stacy," Well, that's better than not in charge at all, I guess."
Candace," It's all about the varying degrees of authority. First, you've got conditionally in charge; then you've got you're basically in charge; you're mostly in charge; and there's just in charge, completely devoid of modifiers. That's what I'm shooting for. Huh? Wait, what are my brothers doing right now? What do you mean you can see it from where you are? See what?!"
Phineas," Check it out, Ferb. We can see Stacy's house from here."
Candace," Phineas, what is this?!"
Phineas, Do you like it?
Candace," Ooh, I'm gonna tell Mom, and when she sees what you're doing, you are going down!"
Candace,If a certain condition arises
Candace,I'm the one to avert the crisis
Candace,"You think you're living large, but you forgot that I'm the one in charge..."
Candace,Conditionally!

Isabella," Wow, chatty."
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us, he bought up 80% of the country's tin foil. (He stops, looking a bit surprised) Carl, didn't-didn't he already do that?"
Carl," (off screen) Yes, sir. At the beginning of summer."
Monogram," Well, all right then. Well, Agent P, go out there and do the same thing you did last time."
Monogram," Good luck, Agent P. Ah, the world of a field agent, out in the thick of things. Not like me."
Monogram, Carl!
Carl," (off screen) Oh, sorry, sir. I thought you were done. You want me to turn 'em back on?"
Monogram," Nah, forget it. The moment's gone."
Phineas," So the way I see it, the solid fuel rockets kick in at the mall parking lot. Then we release the snakes during our corkscrew around the interstate. I'm gonna go get the snakes."
Candace," Mom, you've gotta come home right now."
Linda," Let me guess, a herd of wild moose are in our living room?"
Candace," No. Besides, it's mooses."
Linda," No, I think the word ""moose"" is already plural."
Candace," Mom, trust me, it's mooses...or meese. Do you want me to get a dictionary?"
Linda, Is this what you came here for?
Candace," No, Mom! You've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! They're a building a roller coaster!"

Doofenshmirtz," Ha ha ha! I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil...again. But this time when I put my giant magnet next to my ingenious Magnetism Magnifinator, I will pull the East in a westerly direction, thereby reversing the rotation of the Earth! I know I tried this before but that was with a Magnifier this is a Magnifinator. See, I added the suffix –inator. It's a completely different ball game..."

Candace," Here, look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy! I told you!"
Linda, And you're not crazy because?...
Linda," I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese for everything. (leaves, but comes back) Would you like that, honey? Would you like to yell at some cheese?"
Candace, A little.
Linda," Well, c'mon, then."
Monogram, I hope Agent P is having good luck like I told him to.
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages! May I present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making! Mark your calendars because you will want to tell your grandchildren about the day you rode... The Coolesst Coaster Ever!"

Farmer's Wife," I can't believe you walked all the way to the service station to get the jumper cables, but you didn't bring the battery cart. What did you think a battery cart was just going to fall out of the sky?"
Farmer's Wife, Okay. (smiles hopefully) What did you think a million dollars was just going to fall out of the sky?
Farmer, It doesn't work that way.
Farmer's Wife," Well, how does it work then!"
Doofenshmirtz," Now, you are too late! (He pulls a lever, activating the Magnetism Magnifinator) Quake in your boots and watch helplessly as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces, pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing the rotation of the Earth..."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, that didn't work."
Doofenshmirtz," And now we have a two ton ball of tin foil traveling two hundred miles an hour directly at us! Quickly, we must separate the magnet from the Magnifinator before it is too late!"
Doofenshmirtz," Is it just me or is this a serious déjà vu moment? I feel like I've totally been here before. You were there, the tin foil was coming, and I said ""Quickly, we must separate the magnet"". Huh. Oh, well, weird. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. (Screams)(Resumes trying to move the Magnifinator)"
Woman," Man, is she mad at that cheese"
Candace, Wait a minute. What's going on out there?
Candace," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom?! Mom!?! (She runs back inside.)"
Doofenshmirtz," It's no use! It's no use, we are doomed!"
Doofenshmirtz," You did it! You saved us, Perry the Platypus! You saved us-again, again with the déjà vu. You were up there, I was saying, ""You saved us."" And then, hm, and then something came from that directions... (The tin foil ball crashes into the building) Curse you, déjà vu!"
Candace," Look, look, look, see?"
Linda," (pause) Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at?"
Candace," No, it's not possible!"
Linda, I'm gonna go get the cart.
Candace," I was right here, and it was huge! (She sees the roller coaster being carried away by the helicopter.) Mom!"
Linda, Time to go. I've got frozens.
Candace," Okay, so you think that Phineas and Ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right?"
Linda," Well, yes. That would be my guess."
Candace," Fine. Then let's go home, now!"
