Phineas Flynn," So Ferb, what should we do today? I mean, besides giving Perry a bath."
Phineas Flynn,"What is that wonderful noise? Awesome. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Candace Flynn," Oh, I have got to take a new picture of myself for my blog. I didn't realize mine is already a week old."
Candace Flynn,What are you doing to Mom's car?!
Phineas, We tricked it out!
Candace, You don't even know how to drive.
Phineas," Well, duh. That's why Ferb built this remote."
Candace," Oh, you are so busted. Mom! Mom! Mom! Um, where's Mom?"
Phineas, She's playing bridge at Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro's.
Ferb, [Slams hood]
Candace, They won't get away with it this time.
Vivian Garcia-Shapiro," Oh Candace, dear. Bubela, how good to see you. What a coincidence. Do you know your mom is here?"
Candace," Mmm mmm. Yeah, I do, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro. I need to talk to her if you don't mind."
Vivian, Oy Vey. Look how tall you are now. You must've grown a couple of inches since the last time I've saw you.
Candace," That was last week, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro."
Vivian," Well your mom's inside, dear. Where are your braces? I thought you were wearing braces."
Candace, Yeah. MOM! MOM! MOM!
Linda," What is it, Candace?"
Candace, You have got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!
Phineas," Hey, Ferb. What's the red button for?"
Candace, MOM!
Linda, What is it? What do you want me to see?
Candace, Look!
Phineas, Hi Mom!
Linda," Hi, boys! [At Candace] Now, if that's all, I'll just be getting back to the game."
Phineas, Good thing we've beefed up the suspension.
Phineas,Woah! What else can it do?
Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Hi Phineas.
Phineas," Oh, hi, Isabella."
Isabella, Whatcha doin'?
Phineas, We're entering The Swamp Oil 500 today.
Isabella, Aren't you gonna need a pit crew?
Phineas, Do you know a pit crew?
Isabella," Well, I know a few people who work well together."
Phineas," Great! Your hired! See you at the track. [At Ferb] Hey Ferb, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons completely unknown, he's purchased a giant airship, or Blimp. As the kids say. Your mission is to find out why, and if necessary, put a stop to it."
Isabella, Hi Phineas. I got your pit crew.
Phineas, Cool! See ya in the pits.
Isabella," Okay, girls. We're dealing with a 426 cubic inch, fully-blown V8, with hypo lifters, radical cam and a limited slip differential."
Gretchen, Would that be electronically fuel-injected?
Candace, Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!
Man, Hey! I can't hear the cars!
Jeremy Johnson," Hey, Candace! I didn't know you were a racing fan!"
Candace," Jeremy. [Slaps] Who, me? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm a big fan of those, uh, uh, that red one's cute!"
Jeremy," Oh, that's Billy Ray Digler's car. He's great."
Candace, Yeah. He's the best. That Billy Roy.
Jeremy, Billy Ray.
Candace," Billy Ray. I-I love it when he turns left and then... he turns... left again, and then-"
Dave," And in the 3rd lane, the newcomers Team Phineas! Now is it just me, or does he look a little young to be behind the wheel of a 700 horse power racing machine?"
Rick," Yes, yes he does."
Dave," And look, he's already got his own screaming fans!"
Candace, [On screen] PHINEAS!
Phineas," Hey, Candace is rooting for us!"
Jeremy," Candace, you're on the big screen!"
Candace," [On screen, slow mo] PHINEAS!"
Jeremy, And your little brother's gonna be on TV.
Candace, Phineas? On TV? TV! That's it! They are so busted. Can you wait here for a second? Thanks.
Linda," What is it, Candace? I'm right in the middle of a Three-No trump."
Candace, Turn on the TV!
Linda," All right. All right, Candace. This better be good."
Candace, Well? Well? Do you see it?
Linda," Just a second, honey."
Vivian, Turn on the cable box first.
Linda," Hmm. All right. [CD ejects] Wait... 'kay, that's not it. Um, is it this one? No, this is another phone."
Linda,Oh! I turned on the stereo!
Candace," Mom, hurry up!"
Linda," Okay, just a second!"
TV Narrator, Are you embarrassed about flaking? Itching? Peeling?
Linda," Candace, this is a dandruff commercial. Is there something you're trying to tell me?"
Phineas," Okay, Ferb. Are we good to go?"
Ferb, [Ding]
Rick," And with the race about to start, there's the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated blimp!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus! I'm glad you're here. Actually, I was just getting ready to serve some PLATYPUS UNDER GLASS! You're just in time to witness my latest invention... My Deflate-Inator Ray! Which I will demonstrate by deflating the tires of the Jefferson Motor County Speedway! After which, I will deflate everything in the Tri-State Area! That way, if anyone want's anything flatted, they will have to talk to me."
Candace," Phineas, you are in big trouble, Mister-! [Cars zooming]"
Jeremy," Candace, you got a little-"
Photographer," [Snapshot] Smile! Souvenir picture, only a dollar."
Candace, AAH! Wait a second. [Grabs camera]
Photographer, HEY!
Candace, [Snapshot] Now I gotcha.
Photographer," [Snatches picture] Hey, Missy. Two pictures, two bucks."
Candace," Oh, yeah, uh, I've only got a dollar, but uh, I just want the one. You can just tear the other one up, 'kay?"
Photographer, [Rips picture]
Candace, I've got 'em now! [Laughing]
Rick," And on the fast on the inside lane is Number 42, Team Phineas!"
Phineas," Hey, Ferb. Do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery. But I was thinking: Let's open it up and see what this puppy can- [Classic car honking] Uh, Ferb? We're actually slowing down now. Ferb? Hello? [Car speeds up] OH YEAH! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!"
Isabella," Hey, Ferb. We should bring Phineas in for a pit stop. All right, Fireside Girls, let's move, move move!"
Isabella,That helmet looks so manly.
Phineas, Thanks.
Isabella," Hit it, Ferb. [Tires screeching]"
Isabella,"I'm so proud of you girls. And the bow was a nice touch, Gretchen."
Doofenshmirtz," [Laughing] Listen to those fools, as they worship their candy-colored race car man. How about a little demonstration of my deflationary prowess? [Fires laser]"
Man #2," I got it! [Ball hissing, tires screeching]"
Race Car Driver," AAH! [Tires screeching, rams a sign]"
Rick, The Team Phineas car is avoiding every obstacle! It's like he can see the whole darn track at once!
Isabella/Fireside Girls," ♪ Go Phineas, Go, go Phineas! (X2) ♪"
Phineas, OH YEAH!
Isabella/Fireside Girls," ♪ Go Phineas, Go, go Phineas! (X2) ♪"
Racers, We're okay! [Car zooms by]
Candace," Well Mom, what do you think of this?"
Linda, You've looked better.
Candace, What? What do you mean-
Doofenshmirtz," Already the fear me, listen to their screams, huh? Imagine the mayhem once my Deflate-Inator ray is fully charged. Run! Run like the wind, my little indentured rodent. And I will give you some cheese. Heh, I know I had some around here somewhere."
Perry, [Pulls out briefcase filled with cheeses; Grabs stinky cheese and loads it in crossbow]
Doofenshmirtz, I think there's some- There used to be some Roquefort around the back here. I don't...
Perry, [Fires crossbow]
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm? AIEE! [Screaming] AIEE! [Glass breaks] Agh! Oof! [Laser fires, Blimp deflating] Hmm. I suppose I should have seen that coming."
Candace," But Mom, you've got to believe me! Wait a minute! I bet it's still on TV!"
Linda," That's good, Candace. Go watch a little TV."
Dave, And look at this amazing finish!
Candace, [Stammering] Mom! Come quick! Come look-look-look-look-look!
Linda," All right, I'm coming. [Candace giggling]"
Dave," Oh no! A blimp is about to hit the broadcasting tower! Oh, the hu... [TV Static]"
Linda, Uh huh.
Candace, Meep.
Linda," Deal me back in, Viv."
Phineas, Hmm. Looks like we're walking.
Doofenshmirtz, AAH!
Candace," [Mimicking Linda] ""Why don't you go back home, Candace?"" ""I'm busy with my bridge game, Candace?"" She has no idea!"
Candace,Gotcha.
Doofenshmirtz, AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH! AAH!
Candace, MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM!
Vivian," Oh, Candace, Hello. I can't believe you grown so much, it's unbelievable..."
Candace," MOM! Mom, you've gotta see this! It's about your car!"
Linda, All right.
Candace," Come on, come on, come on!"
Linda," Candace, you're wearing out the heels of my shoes."
Candace," See Mom? Look, look! I told you?"
Linda, [Gasps] But... who did this?
Candace, Phineas and Ferb.
Linda, You mean... they...
Candace," Yeah, yeah, yeah! [Laughing]"
Linda, They washed my car?
Candace, YES! No...what?
Linda," It's beautiful. I gotta admit, I thought you we're exaggerating a bit, but this is really worth getting excited about."
Phineas," Hi, Mom, we're home!"
Linda," Hey, Boys! I saw what you did today."
Phineas, Yeah? How'd you like it?
Linda, I love it. Now who wants some snacks?
Phineas," Thanks, Mom."
Linda," Honey, close your mouth."
