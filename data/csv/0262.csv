Linda," Okay, boys, I'm off to the store for as much Mucus Be Gone as I can carry. Are you sure you're going to be okay?"
Phineas," No worries, Mom. We'll be perfectly fine."
Linda," Well, all right. Bye."
Phineas/Ferb," Bye, Mom."
Candace," (Opens door) Aw, you guys really are sick."
Phineas," Oh, you know us. (Sneezes) Nothing can ever keep us down."
Candace," That's great! You're completely incapacitated! That means I have the whole day to myself! I could spend all day on my Jeremy scrapbook, or I could work on Jeremy, the board game. Or I could go to the mall and watch Jeremy work from my hiding place behind the Weave and Wig. The possibilities are endless! This is gonna be the best sick day ever, for me! (Slams door)"
Phineas," Best sick day ever, huh? (Song plays) Ferb, I know what we're gonna... (Coughs, song distorts) All right, Ferb, implement our Sick Day Video Game Backup System. Ready local area network."
Isabella, Whatcha doin'? (Sneezes)
Phineas," You too, huh?"
Isabella, Where's everyone else?
Baljeet/Buford, Here we are.
Phineas," So, everyone's sick in bed today, huh?"
Buford," Nah, I'm just lazy."
Phineas," Cool, I think. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Agent P, I didn't know you were a germaphobe. (at Carl) Carl, he's afraid of germs, just like you."
Carl," It's not the germs, sir, it's the garlic smell."
Major Monogram," If you have something to say, Carl, spit it out!"
Carl," Ugh, never mind, sir."
Major Monogram," Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has been seen racking up huge bills in Brain, Bath, and Beyond, the area's largest Big Box Mind Control Warehouse store. Get to the bottom of it. Monogram out."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus. I've been expecting you. Sit anywhere, Perry the Platypus, make yourself at home. (laughs maniacally; puts helmet on Perry) So, what do you think of my De-Volitionator? Not to be confused with my De-Evolutionator from a few schemes ago. You see, volition is our ability to choose what we are going to do. Whereas evolution... eh, that's got something to do with monkeys, I think. But this allows me to take over your volition and control what you do. Like this, watch. (Electricity fizzing) How do you feel, Perry the Platypus?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, it doesn't matter because I'm in control. Okay, turn, and... let's go outside and see what this baby can really do! And let's make this snappy, I gotta pick up my daughter by 5:00. You remember Vanessa, right? You know, you blew me up at her birthday party."
Phineas," All right, gang, who wants to go first?"
Phineas,Let's let the computer decide.
Game Voice, Buford vs. Isabella!
Buford, I'm fighting a girl? This'll be easy!
Isabella, Ooh!
Game Voice, Fight-uh!
Game Voice, Patch sash smack attack!
Game Voice, Isabella wins-uh!
Isabella," In your face, Buford! (Sniffles)"
Vanessa," Thanks for driving me to the Scrapyard Invasion party, Mom."
Charlene," Now remember, I won't be able to pick you up afterwards 'cause I'm gonna be getting my nails done. So, I have your Dad picking you up."
Vanessa," Oh, that's cool. If by cool you mean completely embarrassing me in front of the only people whose opinions matter to me."
Charlene, At least he's trying.
Vanessa," Yes, very trying. Do you remember the last time he picked me up?"
Doofenshmirtz," Vanessa, over here! Hop in!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh, don't ask!"
Vanessa, Maybe you should just let me off here. At least I can start the party off with my dignity intact.
Charlene," Whoops, too late! (She stops the car, opening the front passenger door window) Look, it's the only people whose opinions matter to you."
Vanessa," (Waves, embarrassed) Hey, Johnny."
Johnny," Hey, Vanessa. Nice ride."
Vanessa," Yeah, hold on to that thought. My dad's picking me up. (Exits car)"
Charlene, Have fun at the dump. Watch out for medical waste!
Phineas," All right, gang, let's see who's next."
Game Voice, Baljeet vs. Ferrrrrrb!
Baljeet," Oh, great! It is not like Ferb is an internationally ranked video game wizard or anything!"
Ferb, (Sniffles)
Gave Voice, Fight-uh!
Game Ferb, (Runs and kicks)
Game Baljeet, (Punches and kicks)
Game Voice, Baljeet wins-uh!
Baljeet," Ferb, did you let me win to save my fragile, nerdy ego?"
Ferb," Oh, I'd never do that."
Vanessa, Look at all the freaks here.
Johnny," I know, huh? Our peeps. (Shows the phone) And look at this. We're on the Internet."
Vanessa, What?
Johnny," This whole place is wired. They've got cameras everywhere. There's like, dozens of live feeds. Here's the crowd dancing, the DJ. Here's the restroom."
Boy #2," Not cool, man."
Vanessa, Wow! This is like the coolest midday scrapyard rave ever!
Phineas," Okay, Isabella and Baljeet won their battles. So who am I gonna battle?"
Game Voice, Phineas vs. Phineas!
Phineas, Okay. At least I'm evenly matched.
Game Voice, Fight-uh!
Game Voice, Phineas wins-uh!
Phineas, I'm kicking my own butt!
Doofenshmirtz," Left foot, right foot. Left foot, right foot. Okay, now, skip!"
Doofenshmirtz," (In a sing-song manner) I'm controlling Perry the Platypus... and... uh... slap yourself! (He pushes a button on the remote. Perry slaps himself) Haha! (He pushes the button several more times, forcing Perry to slap himself over and over again) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself, hahaha! Hahaha! I can make you do anything!!! (Gasps as he gets an idea) Oh, oh! Eat that gum off the sidewalk!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, gross! You're really going to do it? Perry the Platypus, that's so unsanitary! Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do that?"
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh! Oh, it looks so horrible! I can't look, I can't look! Stop! Stop, Perry the Platypus, stop!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Laughs)Oh, man, that was great. (A beat)"
Doofenshmirt, Now put it back down and do it again.
Johnny," Great place for a dance party, huh?"
Vanessa," Yeah! I just saw a rat! (her phone rings) Ugh, it's my dad. (answers it) Yes, Dad?"
Doofenshmirtz, (Yelling excitedly) PERRY THE PLATYPUS ALMOST ATE GUM OFF THE SIDEWALK!!!
Vanessa, (Annoyed) Is that what you called to tell me?
Doofenshmirtz," No, no. I- I just called to remind you that I will be picking up you and your Visigoth friends up after the dance."
Vanessa," Dad, it's goths, not Visigoths. And they're punks, not goths. (Hangs up)"
Doofenshmirtz," Ah. (Turns to a Visigoth who is standing next to the park bench he and Perry are sitting on) Sorry, Alaric, I thought they were Visigoths. You're not going to impress the punks. You're free to go."
Alaric," (Grumpily, as he leaves) But I still get my pay raise!"
Doofenshmirtz," See, this is what it's like having a teenage daughter. You're never cool enough. Anyway... (With a gleeful look) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?"
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, I can't believe you removed this shopping cart from the supermarket parking lot! You must be feeling so evil! (Laughs) Oh, look at the time. I've got to go pick up Vanessa. Mush, Perry the Platypus, mush!"
Doofenshmirtz,"A junk yard? Why can't they have their party in a nice place, like the Caribou Lodge? You ever been to the Caribou Lodge, Perry the Platypus? They have a nice spread there."
Boy #3," Sweet ride, dude."
Doofenshmirtz," Thank you. Platypus power. (His remote begins beeping) Uh oh. Batteries are low. Hmm... (He looks around for a place to recharge his remote) Take five, Perry the Platypus. (Perry sits down on the ground, and Doofenshmirtz runs over to an amp and plugs in the remote) Whew, that was close. (The remote and the amp begin glowing green; he screams)"
Phineas," Uh oh, power surge."
Phineas," No, wait! Ooh, a Perry level. Nice graphics."
Doofenshmirtz," (On screen) Okay, Perry the Platypus, all charged up and ready to... (Pushes button on remote repeatedly, but nothing happens) Oh, great. Now what's wrong with it? (Perry's left arm moves) I didn't do that!"
Phineas, I did that! But I only seem to have control of his left arm.
Isabella, Let me try! (She pushes buttons on her controller) Cool! I've got control of his left leg!
Buford, I've got his right arm. (Perry is forced to slap himself again) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? (Laughs)
Phineas, Ferb's got right leg.
Baljeet, Oh! I have got back and forth!
Doofenshmirtz, What's wrong with it? Stop that! Stop it!
Baljeet, What is the goal of this game?
Phineas, I'm not sure.
Buford, Who cares? Let's just fight that old pharmacist!
Phineas," Sure! This must be the boss level. All right, guys, we work as a team on this one."
Doofenshmirtz, Uh-oh!
Phineas," Ready stance, now taunt and... jump!"
Phineas," Great leap, leg team!"
Buford, I bet those flies are power-ups.
Phineas, Let's see.
Doofenshmirtz, Oh! Perry the Platypus! Gross! That's worse than sidewalk gum!
Isabella, Oh yeah!
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, what's gotten into you? (gets up and runs away)"
Buford, He's trying to get away!
Phineas, Not on our watch!
Doofenshmirtz," Now, now, Perry the Platypus..."
Baljeet," Eat pig iron, old pharmacist!"
Doofenshmirtz," Stay back, Perry the Platypus! Back!!!"
Phineas, Buford!
Buford, I'm on it!
Isabella," On my mark, guys!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, my. Wait, what..."
Isabella," Baljeet, in!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, why are you moving so deliberately...?"
Baljeet, Roger!
Doofenshmirtz, What are you doing?!
Phineas, Legs...jump...Buford!
Buford, Idiot!
Phineas," Finish him off, Ferb!"
Phineas, Nice one.
Phineas," We won, gang! And if I may be so bold, I claim the right to throw Perry's hat in the air."
Phineas," Huh. Game over, I guess."
Isabella/Baljeet/Buford, Aww.
Vanessa, Dad?
Johnny, That's your dad?
Vanessa, No!
Boy #4," I was at the Caribou Lodge once, and it was just like this."
Vanessa," Dad, why?"
Doofenshmirtz, (Chuckles while sweating) Who's up for charades?
Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, what are you doing down here?"
Vanessa, Dad?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, hi, Vanessa."
Vanessa," Dad, what are you doing?"

Doofenshmirtz,"Wait! Oh wait, no, he's gone! Hey!"
Johnny, (At Vanessa) Your dad's kinda cool.
Vanessa, You're my punk-rock boyfriend! You're not supposed to think my dad is cool! (She walks over to Doofenshmirtz) It only matters that I think he's cool. (Kisses him on the cheek)
Doofenshmirtz, She thinks I'm cool!
Phineas," Well, it looks like all our fevers have broken."
Phineas," Except for Buford, who managed to get sick by laying in bed all day. (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. Just in time for your walk."
