Candace's Brain," Has it come to this? (looks closer) Just standing out in the yard, (Camera zooms out, showing Phineas and Ferb sitting by the tree) Staring at your brothers, waiting? (Zoom into Phineas and Ferb) They're gonna do something bustable, I know it."
Candace's Brain, (Gasps) It's Jeremy!
Candace, (Flips the phone open) I know who it is! (Speaks into the phone) Hi!
Jeremy, Hey! Wanna come over today?
Candace," Uh, yeah, just checking out the situation around here. (At Phineas, covering the phone) Uh, Phineas, do you know what you're gonna do today?"
Phineas, No.
Candace," No jetpacks? No volleyball? No ""Where's Perry""?"
Phineas," Nope, nothing yet."
Candace," (At phone) Yeah, I think I'm free. I'll be right over."
Jeremy, Cool! See ya in a bit! (Hangs up)
Phineas," (Off-screen) Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! (Close up of Candace, who is wide-eyed) Let's build jetpacks..."
Candace, Oh! (Bends down)
Phineas, (Off-screen) ...And play Volleyball!
Candace," Ohh!! (Drops to her knees and drops her phone. She calls Jeremy) Uh, Jeremy, why don't you come over here?"
Phineas," Hey Candace, you seen Perry?"
Candace, Oh!
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P, I want to apologize for my appearance. You see, I was up all night monitoring Doofenshmirtz. It seems that-- zzzzzzzzzzzz.... Yeah, I'll have cake."
Carl, (Off-screen) Sir?
Major Monogram," (Wakes up) --Up all night, uh, building inators. See what he's-- zzzzzzzzzz...."
Carl," (Off-screen) I think you can go, Agent P."
Candace's Brain," Ah yes, now that's bustable behavior. You should tell Mom."
Candace, (whispering) Stop telling me what to do. (At Mom) Mom!
Candace," Mom, Jeremy's on his way over here right now. I've got like 5-10 minutes to get the whole ""Busting-Phineas-and-Ferb"" thing over so I can relax and we can enjoy our Saturday."
Candace,"Linda (While her eyes are on the book) Yeah, chapter almost done. (Looks at Candace) Front yard or backyard?"
Candace, Back. Kitchen door.
Linda, Done and done.
Jeremy," (Wearing a jetpack and has a volleyball in his hand) Hey, Candace! Jetpack Volleyball? This is a great idea! You're gonna join us, right?"
Candace," Uh, yeah! I'll be up in just a second. I just got something I gotta do. (Closes door)"
Linda, I'm ready for our little charade.
Candace's Brain, (while Candace blocks the door) Mom can't see this! We don't want to get Jeremy in trouble! You've got to keep Mom inside!
Candace," (runs off) Oh, Mom! Don't be so silly! You can't go out there until we've uh, uh... (Stammers, pushes Mom to the dishwasher) Unloaded the dishwasher, right! (Chuckles) Right?"
Linda, But they're not dry yet.
Candace," Oh they'll dry, Mom. (Grasps her shoulder) Things dry."
Linda, Ooh-kee.
Doofenshmirtz," (On a cell phone) You really think I need aluminum siding? (Perry crashes through the roof and lands on one knee with a hand to the ground.) Oh, oops, gotta go, I got a guest. (hangs up, turns around and claps) Well, Perry the Platypus. Oh, hey, nice landing pose. See, that would kill my knees. (Pushes a remote) Haha!! You're trapped! (Two floorboards come out and trap him.) Let's talk about what you've been up to, Perry the Platypus. You've been sneaking into my lair secretly and building inators in the middle of the night! (Perry looks confused) Oh, don't act all so innocent. Every morning when I wake up, there's a new inator. Look! See? Three of 'em! (Cut to the inators. Cut back to Perry, who shrugs.) Re-Really, you didn't do it? If it wasn't you, then who was it? I mean, you and I are the only ones who are ever here, which is sad in and of itself. B-But I'm not building them in my sleep! (gasps) Wait, that's it! I'm sleep-inventing! That's fabulous!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, look at you. So evil. I wonder what you do. Le-Le-Let's see. (He activates the first inator. It zaps a table, which turns into confetti.) Wait, how is confetti evil? I mean, it makes a mess, sure, but i-is it really evil? (walks up to the second inator) Alright, let's try this one. (He activates it, it zaps a couch, which turns into a giant cupcake.) A big cupcake? (Walks up to the cupcake) Well, maybe it tastes evil. Yes. (He dips his finger into the frosting and puts his finger in his mouth.) Mmm, yes, chocolate!!! The most evil flavor in— (sighs) Who am I kidding? This is delicious. (Walks to the third inator.) Let's see what this one does. Oh, Norm!"
Norm, Does someone need their spelling checked?
Doofenshmirtz, No. I just wanted to do this! (He zaps Norm with the inator.)
Norm, How about a hug?
Doofenshmirtz, A huginator?!!
Norm, (walking up to Doofenshmirtz) Unable to resist hugging impulse.
Doofenshmirtz, (walking back against the wall) No! No! Noooooo!!!!
Candace, See? I told you they would dry.
Linda, What was that?
Candace," Oh...uh...so, Mom, do you have everything for dinner tonight? Maybe you ought to go to the grocery store."
Linda, Nope. Got everything.
Candace," Oh, it's your bridge day! Better get in the car and go! (pushing her mom out)"
Linda," It's tomorrow. Candace, why don't you go outside and hang out with the boys?"
Candace," Ha ha ha! Outside! Well, there's no reason to go out there!"
Linda," Y'know, I don't hear them. Maybe I'll go check."
Candace," Oh, ow! Ow, ow! (holding her finger)"
Linda," Candace, what is it?"
Candace, I smashed my finger in the...thing!
Linda, Where? Let me see.
Candace, (holds out her finger and moves it) Here!
Linda, Let...me...see!
Candace, I need a bandage!
Linda," Okay, there's some right—"
Candace," No, no! The glow-in-the-dark ones we keep in the emergency kit!"
Linda, In the basement?
Candace, Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow...
Linda, (exits) Okay.
Doofenshmirtz," W-W-What does this mean? (Cut to Doofenshmirtz in Norm's embracing arms) W-When I'm awake I build evil inators that fail, and when I'm asleep, I build nice inators that work? Ah, what is my subconscious trying to tell me? It's just so exhausting. Ugh, I feel like I've been up all night, which, I, I guess I have, building nice inators, apparently. It's just... (droopily) Yeah, I'm getting sleepy. Ripple dissolve imminent."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, man, this had better be a dream because I don't like where this is going."
Linda," Hon, I looked everywhere. I can't find the bandages."
Candace," That's okay, Mom. It's, um, it's all better."
Linda, Great! Then I'm gonna see if the boys want a—
Candace," No! Uh, uh, let's play chess."
Linda," Chess? Candace, I don't—"
Candace," (putting her hands on her mom's shoulders) We never do anything together, okay? (Takes her mom's hand and drags her) Let's play a nice long game of chess."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, man, everything here in dreamland is so distorted and ugly. Say... (Wide shot to reveal a short green devilish imp that looks like him) you look familiar."
Imp, I should. I'm the inner you!
Doofenshmirtz, Inner me?! Are you the one that's been making those good inators?!?!
Inner Doofenshmirtz," I was trying to help you, you nincompoop!"
Inner Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) Yes, late at night, I was instructing you how to make the ultimate inator!"
Inner Doofenshmirtz," (in flashback) That's enough! Don't overtighten it, like your brain! Now, let's just imagine how it will work."
Doofenshmirtz, The Cake-O'-Hug-A-Fetti-inator! Fire!
Skater Dude," What's happening? Dude, is this cake?"
Woman," Ugh, the cake is hugging us!"
Man," Hey, everybody, it's okay! We can eat our way out!"
Man, Ugh! Forget about eating it now! It's covered in paper!
Doofenshmirtz," It's mine! The Tri-State Area's finally mine! (The building disappears and he falls into a throne and gets crowned. The throne floats into the air surrounded by herald trumpets.) Hey, wait a minute! Wait!"
Doofenshmirtz," Now, was that a fantasy inside a flashback inside of a dream?"
Inner Doofenshmirtz," Well, let me put it this way. (Slaps Doofenshmirtz.)"
Doofenshmirtz, What? What? What?!
Norm, Did you have a nice nap?
Doofenshmirtz," Ugh, enough with the hugging! Let go!"
Norm, (lets go of Doofenshmirtz in a manner that sharply throws the evil scientist onto the floor extremely hard) You're da boss!
Doofenshmirtz," (on the ground moaning) Y'know, I'm gonna make a plug for you so I can unplug you."
Linda," Gosh, it's been so long since I've played chess. I can't remember how the knight moves. Do you remember?"
Candace, I'm not really sure.
Linda," (standing up) Oh, the boys'll know."
Candace," What?! (sitting Linda back down) No no no! You sit! I'll go ask 'em. (Runs to the sliding door and imitates the sound of the door opening.) Hey, guys! Uh, do you know how the knight moves? (Doing a bad imitation of Phineas.) Uh, yeah, Candace, it moves straight up and then, uh, straight down on the same square. (normal voice) Oh, hey, yeah, that's great! Thanks! Oh, wait, what was that, Ferb? Oh, yeah, you don't talk! (Imitates the sound of the door closing and draws the curtains on the door.)"
Linda, You know what's funny?
Candace, What's funny?
Linda," I have this weird desire to go outside. (Candace gets more nervous) I mean, normally, around this time of day, you're pulling me to go out in the yard and I kind of have a hankering to do it! It's like a Pavlovian ""go outside"" response. Let's go!"
Candace," Oh, Mom, what are you, a robot? You gotta do the same thing every day?"
Linda," Okay, Candace, what's going on out there? (Linda walks forward but Candace attempts to push her back.) What don't you want me to see?"
Candace," Nothing! Nothing, Mom! (grabs onto her mother's leg) No no no!"
Linda," Candace, let go!"
Candace," Mom, look! Checkmate! (chuckles nervously)"
Linda, Candace!
Candace, Wait! Let's play darts!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, wow, Perry the Platypus, I just had the freakiest dream. You know those dreams that seem logical while you're having them but are total nonsense when you wake up? (Pushing the inators together) I think I was some kind of 1940s business beaver, oh, and, uh... Oh, I might as well get these three useless things out of my lab and push them out onto the balcony and... (Perry struggles to get out of the trap) Wait a minute! I've seen this before! In my dream! That's right! It's only really effective if I put them all together! (Perry gets out of the trap) Hey, hey, Perry the Platy— (Perry flings into him.)"
Linda," I mean it, Candace! You're acting really strange! (Candace dials her phone behind her back.) If I'm gonna go outside, I'm going to go outside! (The house phone rings.) Ugh, there's the phone! Hold that thought! (picks up) Hello?"
Candace," Uh, (holding her nose to disguise her voice) please hold for some important information."
Linda," Well, okay, as long as it's important."
Jeremy," Wow! You guys are the best! This was truly an amazing day! It's too bad Candace missed the whole thing. And, Ferb, where did you learn to serve like that?"
Ferb, At the Yorkshire Athletic School for In Your Face.
Doofenshmirtz," I dare you to try that again! (Perry kicks him again and the inators roll away.) Well, I did dare him, I guess. No! No! (The first inator falls off) A third of my inator! (Wide shot of the building as the falling inator activates)"
Candace," Jeremy? I guess the game is over? (picks up the volleyball, which gets zapped and turns into a cake.) Cake. Okay..."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, Norm, a little help, please!"
Norm, Who needs a hug?
Doofenshmirtz, Noooo!!!
Doofenshmirtz," Norm! What did you do, you big garbage disposal?! Now two of them are ruined! (Sarcastically) W-Why don't you just throw the third one over?!"
Norm, (getting up) If you insist! (Doofenshmirtz flinches in despair realizing what he's done; Norm throws the machine off the balcony)
Doofenshmirtz, Nooooooo-ho-hooooo!!!!
Candace," Well, this has been a weird afternoon."
Jeremy, Candace! There you are! What's all this?
Candace," Well, uh, uh, yeah! Heh! It's our two-month, nine-day anniversary!"
Jeremy," Oh, great! Uh, (at Phineas and Ferb) was I supposed to get her a present?"
Linda," Hon, if you didn't want me to come out and spoil the surprise, you should have said so. But you are going clean up all this confetti, right?"
Candace's Brain, Nice going. You busted yourself.
Candace," Quiet, you!"
Doofenshmirtz, So much for that inator.
Inner Doofenshmirtz," Ugh, tell me about it!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, what are you doing here?! This isn't a dream!"
Inner Doofenshmirtz," Oh, isn't it?"
Doofenshmirtz," No. No, it isn't."
Inner Doofenshmirtz," Oh, crud."
