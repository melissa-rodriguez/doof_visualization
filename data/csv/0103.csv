Kid, ♪ I met my love in a- AAH! ♪
Announcer," Oh, boy! Did that kid stink or what? But maybe YOU'VE got what it takes to be: The Next Super American Pop Teen Idol Star! Auditions open today at the Googolplex Mall in beautiful downtown Danville."
Candace, Auditions?! Today?!
Announcer," Yes, today! At two o'clock sharp."
Candace," (Grabs the TV and kisses it) I gotta tell Stacy! (runs, bringing the TV with her and falls)"
Phineas," That pop star stuff might be fun at first, but then you'd be stuck wirg a dead end job. Too bad you can't just do it once and start over."
Linda," Well, what you're talking about is a one-hit wonder."
Phineas, One-hit wonder? What's that?
Linda," Well, a musical act goes at the top of the charts with a catchy tune and meaningless lyrics."

Linda," Then they throw a big diva tantrum, lose their label, then fade to obscurity. Before they know it, their song ends up as: elevator music. Years later, they have a reunion concert, and after that, they never sing again, and no one remembers them. (tears up, but quickly wipes away tears) Not that I would know anything about that."
Phineas," (writing) A one-hit wonder. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
Candace," But Stacy, what am I going to sing?"
Stacy," Hello, what are you gonna wear?"
Candace, Hmmm. (wears a gown) What do you think?
Stacy, Too much.
Candace, My mom's closet. You like it?
Stacy," Nah, too retro."
Stacy, Perfect!
Candace," Nice, huh?"
Stacy," Yeah, you should've tried that on first."
Candace, Let's go!
Phineas," Chika, chika, choo...wah. Meaningless lyrics done. How's the catchy tune coming along?"
Phineas,"Excellent! We'll be done by lunch! Hey, where'd Perry go?"
Major Monogram, Hello? Hello-oo? Anybody there?
Major Monogram,"Oh, good morning, Agent P. We just received word that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up construction toys at an alarming rate. We need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it."
Linda, We'll meet back in the entrance in an hour.
Candace," Come on, Stacy! We gotta hurry so we could get a spot in li -- yayaya. (realized the line's too long) I've sang in front of so many people!"
Stacy," Uh, Candace? (shows her a LOT more people in the audience)"
Candace, (gasps) I can't do this.
Stacy," Oh, yes, you can. You're not a quitter; you're a fighter!"
Candace, I am?
Stacy," Sure you are! You're a lean, mean, singing machine!"
Stacy,"That's it, yeah! Now you're looking like a winner!"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace."
Candace," (arranges herself) And that is what a gorilla looks like when you try to take away its food. Oh! Hi, Jeremy! Are you auditioning too?"
Jeremy, Nah. I came to see this hot new band called the PFT. I downloaded their song this morning; it's tight! The hundredth contestant gets to sing onstage with the band!
Candace, Really? (walks through the entrance and becomes the 100th contestant)
Jeremy," Hey, looks like that's you."
Announcer, Congratulations! You're the hundredth contestant!
Candace, Phineas?
Phineas," Candace? You're the hundredth contestant? How serendipitous. This'll be like a brother and sister thing! Now I'm assuming you've heard our single. I mean, who hasn't, right? It's a big hit. So here's the words; don't worry if you get lost. The lyrics are meaningless anyway. I'll point when it's your turn."
Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Ferbettes! I'm Phineas and this is Ferb, and we're gonna sing a song!"

Candace, Wait a minute! What are you doing?
Phineas, I'm cuing you?
Candace, How did you get a hit single?!
Phineas," Well, it wasn't easy. It took most of the morning and half a dozen phone calls. But if you learn to put in the work-"
Candace, That's it! I'm gonna tell Mom!
Phineas," Okay, tell her what?"
Candace," (pauses) Ooh, I'm just gonna tell."
Phineas and Ferbettes, ♪ Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you! ♪
Candace," Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, you've gotta see this!"
Linda, Let me guess. Is it unbelieva- (Candace pushes her) WOOAH!
Candace," Come on, come on, come on!"
Ben Baxter," Hi, I'm Ben Baxter, Huge-O-Records. Why don't you come by my office in an hour and we can talk about your future."
Phineas, Future? Cool. He must be a psychic.
Candace," Come on, come on, come on! See? There they are onstage!"
Announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, once again...Marty the Rabbit Boy and His Musical Blender!"
Linda," Come on, we're getting you an eye exam."
Candace," No, no, wait!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ha ha, everything is ready!"
Candace," Ugh! I told Mom I don't need glasses! What the...? (sees a bus of the PFT leaving) No, no, wait! Grrrr. (notices a PFT poster on a building and smiles) MOOM!"
Doofenshmirtz," Sorry, Perry the Platypus, but you are too late! (pushes a lever that makes the building alive as a robot)"
Linda," (wearing a sweater) Ooh, this one's nice."
Candace," Mom, come here. You've got to see this!"
Linda, Candace! I haven't payed for this yet!
Guard, Hey!
Doofenshmirtz," Ha ha ha! When it comes to havoc, nobody wreaks like me!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, wait, wait, you're not supposed to touch that!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, hey, no fair!"
Isabella," Wow, what a great painting! How did you get permission for that?"
Phineas," Oh, they didn't mind. The building's scheduled for demolition."
Candace, See? (sees no building) (screamming)
Guard," Uh, ma'am, you're gonna have to go back and pay for that."
Linda," Yes, of course, officer."
Candace, (Screamming)
Guard," Hey, weren't you Lindana?"
Linda," Oh, yes, I was! I can't believe you recognized me."
Guard," Well, I was a huge fan. (pauses) You still have to pay for the jacket."
Linda, I know.
Doofenshmirtz," Very clever, Perry the Platypus. I tried to ignore you, but you forced my hand."
Doofenshmirtz,"And now...I shall relax with a nice, tasty deli platter. Oh-hooh, where are my manners?"
Ben," Boys, let me start by saying we love your act and we want to be in the Phineas and the Ferb-Tones business. And by the way, aren't you a little young to be pop stars?"
Phineas, No.
Ben," Well, okay, then! We prepared to offer you a very lucrative contract if you'll just sign exclusively with us for your follow-up single."
Phineas," Follow-up single? Who do you think we are, some two-bit hacks who keep writing you songs just because you pay us obscene amounts of cash?! Phineas and the Ferb-Tones are strictly a one-hit wonder! Good day to you, sir!"
Ben," Well, who needs them? We still got this video tape of their performance. We could do live CDs, DVDs, podcasts, and we can digitally re-create their images to make our own sitcom! The Phineas and Ferb Show! We could squeeze twenty years of entertainment out of this one video tape."
Manager, (screams) That giant robot's coming right at us!
Doofenshmirtz," (still pouring pepper) Oh, you sure like a lot of pepper. I'm more of a paprika man myself. (Perry blows over the pepper; Dr. D coughs) It will take more than condiments to foil my brilliant plan!"
Ben, The tape!
Doofenshmirtz, (screamming)
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry."
Phineas,"Come on, guys. We still have one more thing left to do."
Announcer," And the winner of the day's ""Next Super American Pop Teen Idol Star"" is...Marty the Rabbit Boy and his Musical Blender! Oh, give him a hand! He's going to Hollywood!"
Jeremy," Hey, Candace. What's wrong?"
Candace," I'm better than that guy. Ooh, I should've taken blender lessons."
Jeremy, So why did you run off earlier?
Candace, My brothers. (sighs) They always ruin everything.
Jeremy," Well, you like to sing, right?"
Candace, Yeah.
Jeremy," Then you shouldn't let your brothers' fun ruin your good time. You know, if you get a chance to sing, you oughta sing. I gotta go. I'll see you later."
