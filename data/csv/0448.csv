Harry the Hyena, Oh? Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! (grunts) Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, no! The mission!"
Doofenshmirtz,Come on!
Major Monogram, These are the stories of the agents of the O.W.C.A. These are the OWCA Files!
Major Monogram,Act I
Harry the Hyena, Huh? Ha ha ha ha ha!
Leader, Huh?
Enemies, Yahhh!!
Perry, (whistles)
Carl," Whoa, whoa, whoa, Agent P, stop right there! Shut it down! Stop the exercise!"
Carl," Agent P, nowhere in the O.W.C.A. training manual does it say, ""Abandon your team and apprehend the suspect by yourself."" You're not a lone wolf anymore. Your team lacks focus and they need your leadership."
Harry, Ha ha ha!
Maggie," Learn to drive, you jerk!"
Carl," Heck, one of your trainees didn't even show up."
Doofenshmirtz," No, no! I'm here! I'm here! (arrives with some rockets) Just a little late! I'm here! Phew! But it's okay, I made this to help."
Carl, You can't shoot that at a suspect! Are you crazy?! It would blow them to smithereens!
Doofenshmirtz, What's the big deal? I blow up all the time.
Carl," Nevertheless, individually, your scores look promising, but there's still a big problem with teamwork."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, bub, it's just a piece of clipart."
Harry, Hee hee hee hee hee...
Carl," And, Doofenshmirtz, you're lucky you're legally considered an ocelot, or you wouldn't be here at all!"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah. I'd say that's probably the first time anyone has described my being abandoned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats as ""lucky""."
Doofenshmirtz, You're gonna be wearing that thing in a second.
Harry, Heh...heh heh heh...
Doofenshmirtz," Besides, I've, I've given up evil."
Carl," Look, if you guys can't pass this training exercise, there's no way you'll complete ""Town Square Riot"", ""Freeway Assault"", or ""Escape the Ancient Ruin"". Agent P, your trainees need to learn how to work together as a team or they're never gonna earn their black hat bands. And, uh, Karen? (takes out a laser pointer and points it at Karen, who is chasing a butterfly) Karen the Cat. Pay attention. Karen, I'm over here."
Karen, Meow.
Carl," Follow the light. That's right. Now, you're going to have to do the entire training exercise again."
OWCA Day-Players, Yay! High five!
Carl," No, I'm not approving overtime. We'll do it without you day-players."
OWCA Day-Players, Awwww...
OWCA Day-Player, Come on. Let's just storm out as if we have somewhere else to go.
Major Monogram," Carl, when you're finished with Agent P's team on the backlot, return to headquarters immediately."
Carl," Sorry, Agent P. Gotta go. (gives Perry the laser pointer and the manual) Carry on. And remember! Teamwork!"
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, can we still use this thing? (He activates the rocket and it blasts into an unknown area.) Heh heh heh. Well, y'know, hopefully that didn't hit anything important."
Napoleon, The dust clears and here we are.
Napoleon (cont'd), OWCA Secret Headquarters.
Wendell, Doesn't look very secret to me.
Napoleon," Be that as it may, today is the day that we will become OWCA's first insect agents."
Wendell, But they never responded to our applications.
Napoleon," Yes, and I can't understand why. We mailed them in on time, right before the year-end deadline."
Major Monogram and Agents," Three, two, one!"
Carl, Happy New Year!
Napoleon," It's possible that our applications have fallen through the cracks. Which is why we are following up with a personal visit. That's how you get noticed, and that's how we will become agents. Imagine fighting international supervillains, traveling to exotic locales."
Wendell," And I'm gonna get all kinds of cool spy stuff, like a jet pack, a tuxedo and scuba fins!"
Wendell," Yeah! That oughta do it! (He turns on his jet pack setting his house on fire and bumping into the ceiling.) Napoleon, I can see your house from here!"
Wendell," How 'bout you, Floyd? What do you want? Uh, a fountain pen that shoots lasers? (gasps) Or a car that shoots fountain pens?"
Floyd, I want a monkey.
Napoleon," Mmm, yes. For whatever twisted reason, you shall acquire your primate."
Floyd, Monkey.
Napoleon," Yes, a monkey is a... You know what? Nevermind. My point is, now that we're here, all we have to do is get someone's attention. Ah, here comes a helpful looking lad now. Excuse me, sir— (Carl steps on the bugs) Obviously, we need to try a different approach."
Floyd, I still want a monkey.
Major Monogram," Carl, this new facility is really impressive. Now, tell me again where you found the money for all these improvements."
Carl, I just solved a small ongoing accounting error. You kept putting decimal points where you needed to put commas.
Major Monogram," Oh, I see! Improper punctuation. Say, how is Agent P's team shaping up?"
Carl, Well...
Major Monogram," Great! Agent P is the best we have. If anyone can get that team in shape, it's him."
Carl," Yes, sir, but I—"
Major Monogram," Carl, isn't it time that we talked about the elephant in the room?"
Carl," What do you mean, sir?"
Major Monogram," Well, what exactly is he doing?"
Carl, Obviously something's itching him.
Major Monogram," And Agent W, too."
Major Monogram (cont'd), It's really taking a toll on our brand new facility.
Carl, I don't understand all the itching. I handed out the new flea collars this morning.
Major Monogram," Then something's not right because OWCA is infested with fleas. Carl, activate emergency flea protocol 993-alpha."
Carl," (on a communication device) Agent C, activate emergency flea protocol 993-alpha."
Agent C, Bawk!
Agent I, (gasps)
Carl," Okay, everyone. When the sensors stop detecting the presence of fleas, the doors will automatically open. Agents, prepare for flea fogging."
Napoleon," This must be our first test, gentlemen. As agents, we must know how to elude things like deadly toxic clouds."
Wendell," Just for the record, that was not me."
Napoleon," Yes, Wendell, I— Let's just get down in that drawer."
Napoleon," Look at all this spy equipment! (looks at a pair of scissors) Some sort of giant cutting device, latex bands, miles of insect rope, giant fly— Aah! Whoa!"
Floyd, (behind a magnifying glass) What is happening to me?
Napoleon," Look at this magnification apparatus that Floyd has found. This could be just the thing we need to get noticed. (sniffs, to Wendell) Okay, that was you."
Wendell, Guilty. Sorry.
Carl," Fogging sequence complete. Flea problem solved, sir."
Major Monogram," First, the flea collars don't work and now fogging doesn't take? What kind of fleas are these?"
Agent D, Grrr!
Carl," Agent D, would you mind? (lifts Agent D's flea collar and gets a flea with some tweezers) Hmm. Gotcha! Let me see something."
Wendell and Napoleon, (grunting)
Napoleon, Okay. Gently lower it into place. All we have to do is get up there—
Napoleon," Aw, nuts."
Napoleon," There. You see? It's a good thing we let go, otherwise, we would've ended up just like that peanut."
Bug Trio, Whoa!!
Carl," Oh, my gosh! It's a tiny robot!"
Major Monogram, What kind of a freak would make robot fleas?
Villain, Hello.. (laughs) Francis Monogram! (laughs)
Major Monogram, Great googly moogly! Who are you?
Villain," I am Professor Parenthesis. Although, I'm not really here. This is a holographic image."
Carl," Major, I'm looking up Professor Parenthesis in our database. There's not much on him."
Parenthesis, It's Parenthesis! Not Parenthesis!
Carl, Are you sure? Because it's spelled—
Parenthesis, You would think I would know how my own name is pronounced.
Carl," Yeah, you'd think."
Major Monogram, Why are you here?
Parenthesis, You don't remember me. We were in biology class together long ago. You barely noticed me.
Major Monogram," You're not that guy who kept eating his own hair, are you?"
Parenthesis, No. That was Jeffrey Stovel.
Major Monogram, Were you the kid who got his chin stuck in that graduated cylinder?
Parenthesis," No, that was Jennifer Stillwell! And she was a girl! All you need to know is that I'm the one who sent those flea collars!"
Major Monogram," Oh, are you that kid who wore that Robin Hood hat and passed out in the drinking fountain?"
Parenthesis," Billy Eujeka! And can we move on, please?"
Major Monogram," Yeah, sorry. So, why did you send those flea collars?"
Parenthesis," Well, it's taken me 30 years to come up with a plan this diabolical. Five of those years were spent in villains academies. Then, after school, I started working on that screenplay I always wanted to write. But revenge was always on my mind, Francis Monogram!"
Major Monogram, Stop saying my name like that!
Carl, Didja ever finish that screenplay?
Parenthesis, This is my screenplay! (hands Carl his screenplay) Right here. I'd like to get your notes.
Carl," Oh, I'd be happy to. (tries to pick it up, then remembers it's a hologram. To Monogram) Seriously?! You don't remember this jerk?!"
Major Monogram, Were you the kid who...
Parenthesis, The robot fleas were actually inside the flea collars that you put on all of your agents. Now this remote will give me complete control over all of them!
Parenthesis," (maniacal laugh) And now, Francis Monogram, say goodbye to your precious OWCA! (maniacal laughter, then disappears, but reappears, to Carl) Seriously, though. I'll email you the screenplay. Tell me what you think. (disappears again)"
Carl," Sir, he's turned all of our animal agents against us!"
Major Monogram," Carl, are you familiar with the term ""a-duh""?"
Major Monogram,Act II
Carl," (offscreen) What are we gonna do, sir?!"
Major Monogram, Do we have any agents on the outside? Anyone without a collar?
Major Monogram," Agent P. Come in, Agent P. Oh, good, you're all right. We need your help. OWCA's on lockdown. We're trapped!"
Major Monogram, And all of the agents are being controlled by a sinister being named Professor Parenthesis.
Carl," That's Parenthesis, sir."
Major Monogram," Oh, right. Anyway, Parenthesis is using robot fleas to control our agents' minds..."
Carl, Left turn!
Major Monogram, Whoa! He snuck the fleas into OWCA Headquarters by hiding them in a shipment of flea collars.
Carl, Right turn!
Major Monogram," And now he's...Hey, Carl! Whoa! Anyway, he's controlling them with a small remote device. It's up to you and your team to find Parenthesis and destroy that remote. You're all we've got on the outside, so..."
Carl, Wet floor!
Major Monogram, Whoa! Great googly moogly!
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, that sounds kind of serious. Guess the first thing we should do is start looking for clues? Huh? Huh?"
Maggie, (repeating what Monogram said) Shipment of flea collars!
Doofenshmirtz," It's the box those flea collars came in. And there's his return address. ""The Bottom of the Grand Canyon."" Hey, hold on a second. Parenthesis! I know that guy! I met him at an evil convention about three years ago. Walks around in those pink slippers pushing his screenplay on everyone. Sure. (closeup on Doof) And now we got his home address! (Long shot to reveal Doof alone.) Perry the Platypus, we should go to your secret lair and get your hover car... (the rest are already ahead) Okay, fine, just... Just remember it was my idea!"
Napoleon," Well, that did not go as planned."
Wendell," (offscreen) Hey, Napoleon, there's peanut butter over here!"
Napoleon," Floyd, your head is upside-down."
Wendell," There's peanut butter over here, too! (gasps) There's peanut butter all over!"
Napoleon," Yes, well, there's always a silver lining, isn't there? I think the problem is we need to be up on their eye level."
Wendell, Like those guys up there?
Napoleon, Uh...yes?? And no.
Butterfly, Tell my wife I love her.
Napoleon," While th-their position is not advantageous, they are illuminated by a light, which gives me an idea."
Doofenshmirtz," (panting) Man, you guys are... You guys are fast. Ah, so this must be your...your host family's house. What's with all the rockets in the r— Oh, those are mine! That must be where they landed! Wh-What a coincidence! Well, it's a good thing they're not armed or... (The rockets start beeping. Doof chuckles.) Don't worry, Perry the Platypus. Everything is gonna be okay."
Doofenshmirtz," If I can get a ladder, I can defuse them before they blow up. (Notices the house is destroyed.) Eh. Well, on the bright side, now we don't have to find that ladder."
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, what a mess. But don't worry, Perry the Platypus. OWCA's got plenty of money now. They'll... (snaps fingers) They'll fix this place up before your host family even gets back and they'll, they'll replace all this junk with...y'know, pretty much identical junk. (Harry gives him a look.) What?"
Doofenshmirtz, (screamming)
Karen, REOW!!
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, see? A cat always lands on my feet."
Karen, Meow.
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, Perry the Platypus, is this your lair? Nice! At least it, it would be if it wasn't so, y'know, blown to smithereens. (He picks up and throws away a Perry the Inaction Figure.) Oh, hey, an underwater diving capsule. (He knocks it over.) Man, I see why you never use it. ♪ Fragile! ♪ And is that a pressurized space suit? 'Cause that is not what you wore when we were in space. Hey, check this out! (Picks up the locket from Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension.) Oh, you look so young! Who's a widdle pwatypus?! (He hears Perry starting his hovercar.) Where do you think you're going? (He throws the locket in the toilet.) No-no-no-no-no-no, look. I know you might be a little upset, what with your house and your lair so exploded and all, and... And I have to admit that I feel...slightly responsible..."
Maggie, (imitating the rockets) Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep... PYEOW!!!
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, thanks for the recap, Maggie. Anyway, you can't just go off and solve this without me."
Harry, (snorts)
Doofenshmirtz," I was getting to you guys. I mean, without me and them. And the cat, wherever the..."
Karen, (purrs)
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm. Anyway, I know we can't all fit in this, but...if we work together, there's a lot of blown up stuff lying around here, and I'm, I'm sure we can jury rig something that will carry, y'know, all of us. Like a well-bonded machine."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, the welds aren't really bonded on this machine, so, y'know, try not to move around too much in flight. Grand Canyon, here we come!"
Narrator, 5 hours later...
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah. If anyone happens to see a canyon that looks sorta grandish, just speak up. Or maybe not speak up, maybe meow up, or squawk, er, whatever it is that you do, up."
Maggie, Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet?
Harry," Ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee! (sighs, groans)"
Doofenshmirtz, Yeah.
Doofenshmirtz and Maggie, Are we there yet?
Doofenshmirtz," (to Perry) I have no way of knowing, because I've never been there, and...you don't talk."
Maggie, Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather)
Doofenshmirtz," Man, these guys are really annoying. Doncha think?"
Doofenshmirtz," I'm right, aren't I? Annoying. Yeah, I'm right."
Parenthesis," ♪ Beautiful lunchtime, at my secret lair, in the Grand Canyon. ♪ Ah, I'm starving."
Parenthesis," Well, that was delightful. I couldn't eat another gram."
Parenthesis," Well, well. It appears someone has flown into my airspace. Perhaps we should send a welcome party."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, the Grand Canyon. It's nice. You got the Colorado River, you got the giant robot fleas. you got these nice red rocks right h— (gasps) Wait a second! The Colorado River?! I thought we were in Arizona! (gasps) And wait another second! Giant robot fleas?!? Yeah, those are definitely the attack drones of an evil scientist. Yeah, y-you're gonna wanna punch it."
Doofenshmirtz," All right! Nice one! Oh, let me help. We gotta have some weapons around. Wait wait wait, what does this lever do? (pulls the lever several times) No, no, no, that, uh, it doesn't...it doesn't seem to do anything. (Cut to reveal Perry's seat hitting him, revealing what it does.)"
Doofenshmirtz," Give me something to hit him with. (Takes the football helmet Karen is sitting in.) Thanks, Harry."
Karen, REEEEERR!
Doofenshmirtz, Take that!
Maggie, We lost the cat! We lost the cat!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, relax. The cat's right... (realizes she's gone. Rotates his seat at the fleas.) Take that! And that! One for you, too! There you go! Uh-oh. Where's Harry? Oh, there he is! I see a bright future for that kid. Well, y'know, if we survive today. Oh, and there's Karen. Hi, Karen!"
Carl, (whispering) The access vent won't take us any further.
Major Monogram," The hallway is crawling with compromised agents. We're gonna hafta do some creative sneaking, Carl. Follow my lead. (They sneak around.) The cobra. (They do a pose, while Agent C passes by, not noticing them. They start sneaking again.) Andalusian dog. (They pose again, while Agent F passes by.)"
Agent F, Ribbit. Ribbit. Ribbit.
Major Monogram, Violin and candlestick. (They pose as Gary the Gander flies past them. They jump over some lamps and a desk chair offscreen.) Garden party.
Carl, (offscreen) Garden party?
Major Monogram, (offscreen) Just give me your ankles.
Napoleon, There. That should be sufficient wattage to illuminate us.
Wendell, Why do we wanna be laminated?
Napoleon, Not laminated. Illuminated. It means to have light shown upon us.
Wendell, Like a grape?
Napoleon, Yes. Like... Like a grape?
Wendell," Yeah, I saw a grape this morning."
Napoleon, And there was light shining on it?
Wendell," You saw it, too?"
Napoleon, Moving on. Do we have enough power for all these lights?
Wendell," Yup. We're all plugged into that plug collector thingy, and all we have to do is turn it on."
Napoleon," Well, let's do that then."
Wendell, Yes! And then we can all be laminated!
Napoleon," No, it's illu... You know what? Nevermind. Floyd, when we get up on the box, you throw that switch!"
Floyd, I like laminated grapes.
Major Monogram," Come on, Carl. Let's get outta here! (he opens the door, but it is blocked) Carl, what the heck?!"
Carl," Well, it never occurred to me that the emergency exit would be locked down, too."
Major Monogram, Isn't that something you should've checked before we crawled through all that duct work?
Carl," I suppose... but, I was... just having so much fun sneaking around with you."
Major Monogram," Actually, I was kinda havin' fun, too. Heh heh. Nevertheless, this isn't a situation to make light of."
Napoleon," Okay, Floyd. Make some light!"
Floyd, (jumping off the garbage can onto the switch) Weeee.
Floyd,Act III
Major Monogram," Ooh! (chuckles) Uh, (points to his right) We went that way! (runs the other direction)"
Carl, Heh heh heh... uhhhh... additional misdirect! (follows Monogram)
Wendell, Down here!
Wendell,Look down here!
Wendell,Please!
Wendell,"Friends, we need you!"
Napoleon,
Napoleon,Hello!
Napoleon,Hello!
Napoleon,Can you see and or hear us?!
Wendell," Floyd, focus the beam!"
Floyd," Stop, drop, and roll, sir."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, you know what they say. Any landing where you don't get stabbed with a fork is a good one. And I didn't get stabbed with a fork. Any of you guys? Hello? Harry?"
Harry, (whistles)
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, there he is. Impressive! Y'know, as, as evil lairs go, I give that, like, an eight. It looks like a classic mid-'60s megalomaniacal design. And the water feature is very nice. Fortunately, I know a thing or two about... (pull out to reveal Doof alone again) Sheesh! (Doof goes over to the others, who are looking at a scale model of the lair.) Oh, heh. Yeah, w-way to get the ball rolling there, Perry the Platypus. I-I see you're gonna use the... (looks at the manual) Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique, or SEFIT. Man, these guys are really bad at acronyms. Good choice, though. Wh-What do I get to do? (stammers) What's my part? (Perry points behind Doof as he sees a coffee shop.) Oh, I'm the coffee guy. Good start. We're gonna need to stay sharp on this one."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I'm back. Eh, who had the double espresso? (Harry takes it.) There you go. And a caramel macchiato. (Maggie takes it.) Maggie. And I guess that means that Perry the Platypus had the... Yes, the oolong tea, of course. And I got a scone, but it was like, five dollars. So I only got one. Oh, you got little figurines. There's Harry, and Maggie, and eh, where's my little guy? (Perry picks up a rock and paints a crudely-drawn Doof onto it.) Ah, that's sorta nice, it's... (Perry places Doof by the model of the coffee shop to make a point.) Oh, wh-wh-while you guys do that, I'll just be back...over... Alright, well, I guess I'll just be over... over here if you need me."
Doofenshmirtz,And now my little guy's got shattered dreams. ♪
Doofenshmirtz, I could a helped. I understand the Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique. Step one: Diversion.
Parenthesis," (to his robot fleas) Jason, Shirley, water is no longer coming out of my hole. Get down there and see what you can do about it."
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) Step two: Immobilization.
Doofenshmirtz," Step three: Infiltration. They'll take them completely by surprise. They'll just walk right in the door past that giant lava lamp, and... Why would there be a giant? (record scratch) IT'S A TRAP!!"
Parenthesis," Ah, Perry the Platypus and friends. Right on time. Actually, you're a little early. (drops open the trap door) Ah, now you're on time!"
Parenthesis," Well, well, well, now that you're all bottled up, I'm free to go to OWCA for the culmination of my evil plan! In 28 minutes, my fleas will have worked their way into each agent's neuro-pathways. And then my mind control will be permanent! I will single-handedly take control of every OWCA agent! (to some fleas) Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, to the Parentho-Copter! (to the trainees) I hope you find my accommodations uncomfortable. (lights a wrecking ball on fire and releases it) And yes. Soon it will be worse."
Karen, Meow!
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, looks like you might need my help after all! Lucky for you I brought a rope, with a dreamcatcher on the end! That's what you call style! Anyway, alright, here, catch. (throws the dreamcatcher at Karen, but she pushes it off the edge) Uh, Karen, I don't think you're grasping this whole ""grab the rope"" concept. Can someone else get this one? (it gets tangled in the wrecking ball) Oh, great, now it's tangled in the... (The wrecking ball ends up in the capsule.) Wow! Did you guys see that? I almost got— Alright, minor setback. No problem. I'm just gonna have to come down there and get you myself. (Pushes a rubber raft through the door.) See, this is why I brought the raft."
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I might have a little bit of a problem (falls down and ends up in the water. He gets on the raft but is surrounded by alligators.) Get back, you, before I get all Creole chef on you! (to the trainees) Come on, you guys! Jump! I gotcha! I gotcha! I got— (the trainees jump into the raft)"
Karen, Reeeeeooww!
Doofenshmirtz," See? A cat always lands on my feet. Wait, nobody move. Here. (takes a selfie) That's going on my blog."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, uh, that can't be good."
Doofenshmirtz," Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Woo! Woooo! I did it! I saved you guys and now we're safe! (some alligators land in their raft) Except for the fact that it's, you know, raining alligators. And secret lairs."
Doofenshmirtz,Act IV
Major Monogram," Good thing we found a hiding place, Carl. What is this? A dining room table or something?"
Carl," It's a desk, sir."
Major Monogram, A desk we can both hide under? Whose office is this anyway?
Carl," It's mine, sir."
Major Monogram, Yours?! This is at least ten times bigger than my office!
Carl," Sir, that's not important now! We need to find a way to escape!"
Major Monogram, And how do you rate your own bathroom?
Carl," It's actually a gym, sir."
Major Monogram, Is that a chocolate fountain?
Carl," Sir, listen. I got an idea. If we can get to the evacuation wing, we might be able to use one of the escape pods."
Major Monogram, What's up with the giant bear?
Carl, Oh. That was a gift from our contractor.
Major Monogram, That gives me an idea! But this conversation isn't over.
Carl," I can't see back here, sir."
Major Monogram," You drew the short straw, Carl."
Napoleon," Just a little higher. Ah, we've finally reached the summit. Come, gentlemen, it's time to get noticed!"
Wendell," Oh, boy! Oh, sorry, Floyd, are you okay?"
Floyd," Wendell, I've had an epiphany! In order for us to obtain our noble goal, we must evaluate the— (groaning) Ow."
Wendell," Sorry, Floyd, did you say something?"
Floyd, I like trains.
Wendell," Oh, my! By my larva-making mother, would you look at that! It's like the floor is frozen, but it's warm. It's like warm ice. Did we discover this? We should call it ""wice""."
Napoleon," Actually, it's called glass."
Wendell," No. I think it should be some combination of warm and ice. Floyd, come take a look at this!"
Floyd, I need a face shoe.
Wendell," So, what's your plan, Napoleon?"
Napoleon," Ah, it's quite simple, actually. We are standing atop a giant duplication device. A device that will not only copy our images, but will enlarge us as well. I simply need to program in the right size. Let's see. 200% enlargement. Okay, men, get on the glass platen, and get ready to be enlarged."
Wendell," All set, Napoleon!"
Napoleon, And (jumps on the button) copy! Everyone smile for the camera. (The copier scans them) Excellent! Now we just have to wait for the toner to do its work.
Napoleon,"Wendell Wow, it's a good thing that lid didn't fall on us. That would've hurt."
Napoleon," Well, yes, Wendell, that was fortune..."
Doofenshmirtz," Y'know, it, uh... It could've been worse. Uh, don't..don't all thank me at once. Knowing my talent has served my fellow agents is thanks enough."
Maggie, Rawk! Lousy rescue!
Doofenshmirtz," I wouldn't call it lousy, per se. A little off, maybe, but... Oh, come on. Harry the Hyena, it was a good rescue, wasn't it?"
Harry," A-hee-ha-ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha ha ha ha ha. Eh, heh heh... Eh... Nah."
Doofenshmirtz," Karen the Cat? Anything? Uh, no? What did you think of the rescue, Perry the— (Perry throws the training manual at Doof) Ow! (Perry takes off in his jet pack) Hey, Perry the Platypus, you're leaving us?!"
Doofenshmirtz," (shooing the letters away) Knock it off! Hope that's not permanent. Oh, I get it! H-Hey, hey, you guys, come back. Come back! Now, let me just explain."
Doofenshmirtz,"Wait a minute, guys. Bear with me just a second here, okay. Watch this, ready?"
Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that was easier than I thought it would be. If only we had a ""W"", we could spell out ""teamwork""."
Maggie, Macaw!
Doofenshmirtz," (gasps) That's right! ""Macaw"" has a ""W"" in it! So we can do it! Okay, here, from the beginning."
Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, big finish!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, now let's spell out ""collaborative alliance""."
Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, no, I'm just kiddin'! I'm kidding! Come on back! Hey, uh, guys, you, y-you forgot the cat. (to Karen) They forgot you. And you're the cat."
Carl," There it is, sir! The escape pod!"
Major Monogram, Great! Let's get outta here!
Carl," Okay, sir, but be careful. There's a huge set of stairs."
Major Monogram," (sarcastically) Well, that went well."
Carl," Sarcasm isn't helping, sir."
Major Monogram," Aw, there we go— Aw, ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Carl," Okay, this button launches the escape pod."
Major Monogram," (offscreen) Uh, Carl, how does the escape hatch work with, you know, this whole lockdown thing?"
Carl, (offscreen) Uhhh...
Major Monogram, Owwwwwww.
Parenthesis," Well, well, well, Francis Monogram! It's hostile takeover time!"
Major Monogram," Carl, how was he able to override the lockdown?"
Carl," Well, it opens from the outside, sir."
Major Monogram, Ehhh.
Major Monogram,Act V
Major Monogram," Okay, you made your point, Parenthesis. Apparently, I didn't notice you in school. Sad story. Boo-hoo. But why are you here?"
Parenthesis, I'm here to make your days the darkest of grays and your nights the blackest of black. I want to see your smug smile melt away like the candles on a sad little abandoned birthday cake.
Carl, Sounds like he's here to bore us to death.
Parenthesis," As soon as my mecha-fleas completely override your agents' natural instincts, I will release them out into the unsuspecting world, where they will wreak havoc. And all you'll be able to do is sit and watch as the people of the world grow to deride and despise Francis Monogram and his monstrous OWCA as much as I do!!"
Carl, (to Monogram) How about now?
Major Monogram," No, I still don't remember him!"
Wendell," Wow, Napoleon, we're huge!"
Napoleon," Yes, this is bound to get us noticed."
Wendell, So how do we get them to see it?
Napoleon," Well, it would be preferable if it were at their eye level."
Floyd, We could build a paper airplane.
Napoleon," If we could find a staple remover, some dental floss... Wait, Floyd, what did you say?"
Floyd, I want a monkey?
Napoleon," No, what did you just say?"
Floyd, I want a monkey.
Napoleon, What were the last words out of your mouth?
Wendell," Well, actually, those were the last words out of his mouth. You asked him, ""What did you say?"" And he said, ""I want a monkey."" He said it twice, if you count this last time."
Napoleon," Well, I...I... Okay, Floyd, immediately before you said ""I want a monkey"" twice..."
Floyd, I don't want two monkeys.
Wendell, Is this about the face shoe?
Napoleon," Oh, forget it! We're making a paper airplane!"
Parenthesis," Almost out of time! The suspense is delicious, don't you think? (laughs)"
Major Monogram," Hey, Parenthesis, I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you. Heh heh."
Parenthesis, What?
Major Monogram," Nice upholstery job, Agent P! We got this guy. You take down Parenthesis."
Parenthesis," Agents, you know what to do."
Agent E, (trumpets)
Parenthesis, Excellent! Soon all this will be mine! First thing I'll do is put that sofa back there on the atrium where it belongs. Then I'll—
Carl," Oh, my gosh!"
Carl, Does that mean what I think it means?
Major Monogram, No. It means Parenthesis was... a robot.
Carl," Alright. Well, now I'm confused. What did you think I thought it meant?"
Napoleon, There. This seems aerodynamically sound.
Wendell, Now all we need is a big rubber band and two palm trees to launch us!
Napoleon," You watch way too much TV, Wendell."
Wendell," Oh, just the one show."
Napoleon," But, perhaps some form of propulsion would be beneficial. (Looks at the fan.) Hmmm."
Floyd," Uh, guys. (cut to reveal Floyd's head not attached to his body) I think I got a paper cut."
Napoleon," Uh, Wendell."
Wendell, I'll go get the gauze.
Major Monogram," Well, I guess that's that. We should get that remote device and... (looks inside the body) Whoa! (the robot body grabs Monogram, and pushes Carl, and Perry onto the sofa.) Oh, no, I can't. (The robot body lifts Monogram up in the air so he can see inside.) What?"
Parenthesis, (laughs maniacally) Aloha!
Major Monogram, Wait. You're a flea?
Parenthesis, Recognize me now?
Major Monogram, Why would I recognize a flea?
Parenthesis," See? See? There's that attitude again! (A TV set with multiple mechanical arms pops out of the robot's body. The TV shows the flea's face.) You've always looked down your nose at me. Well, now, who's beneath who?"
Parenthesis," He's getting away! He'll ruin everything! Hold these, guys. Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, you're with me!"
Wendell," Napoleon, how are you steering this?"
Napoleon," I'm not, Wendell. We are at the mercy of the wind! YEEHAW!!"
Parenthesis, Get him!
Parenthesis, Where did the platypus go? (gasps) Connie! There you go. Lemme just straighten your collar. To the freeway!
Parenthesis," How about a little oncoming traffic, you portentous platypus?"
Parenthesis, Yes! Finish him!
Parenthesis, What's this?
Parenthesis," Here, little semi--aquatic mammal. Here, boy. Nowhere to turn now! Oh, look, I'm wearing glasses. I'm a hipster."
Parenthesis," Okay, end of the line, platypus! You've nowhere to... Oooh, cotton candy! Give me some of that!"
Parenthesis," Does anyone see him? He's small, teal, wears a hat. Oh, come on. How hard is it to find a small platypus in a carnival setting? Don't say it! I just heard myself."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, yeah! Great throw, Harry!"
Harry, Ha ha ha ha ha!
Maggie, (squawks)
Parenthesis, Whoa!
Maggie," Mmm, got it!"
Doofenshmirtz, Woohoo!
Harry, Yeah!
Doofenshmirtz," Thanks for believing in your team, Perry the Platypus."
Parenthesis," You think this cage can stop me?! (tears the gate off, grabs the agents and laughs) I have you now!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great! Karen's here! We're saved!"
Maggie, We're dead!
Doofenshmirtz," Gwan, Karen, do your thing."
Parenthesis," Oh. I forgot the feline. Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, take the cat out."
Karen, Reeeeor!
Parenthesis, What?! No! You'll pay for that!
Parenthesis, Wah! (gasps) My slipper! Ahh! NO!
Karen, (screeches)
Parenthesis," Hey! Ow! Aw! Ow! (sighs) Oh, well, you guys do work well together. But to no avail. I may be boo-boo'd and bruised, but I still have control over OWCA's agents! Ha! And it all becomes permanent in just five more seconds! (something is heard falling from the sky. It is the fan falling on Parenthesis)"
Wendell," Hey, Napoleon, our motor came off."
Doofenshmirtz, (gathering the flea with tweezers) And gotcha!
Major Monogram," Well done, team! You've earned those black hat bands. You are now officially OWCA agents!"
Wendell," Look, Napoleon. They got to be agents."
Napoleon," Yes, and not us. (The plane begins to plummet.) Whoa! (sighs) We should take this as a sign. (takes up a violin) Bugs are not meant to be agents. (plays ""Nearer My God to Thee"") Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure serving with you. (The wind carries them off.) Whoa!"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, hey, now that we're agents, when do I get to use this thing? (launches a rocket launcher) Whoa! (The rockets crash into the OWCA headquarters.) Oops, sorry."
Major Monogram, Carl?
Carl," There's still money in the budget, sir."
Napoleon, I don't believe it! We've landed safely! I take this as a sign! We will be the best agents that OWCA has everyday!
