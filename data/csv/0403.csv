Candace, (On the phone) You'll never guess what I'm doing tonight.
Stacy," Well, you might be..."
Candace," Going on a big date, but guess with whom?"
Stacy, Obviously—
Candace, It's Jeremy. (Squeals) But you'll never guess where.
Stacy, (Sighs) I have no idea.
Candace, Neither do I. He says it's a surprise.
Stacy," Oh, lucky you."
Candace," The problem is if I don't know where we're going, I don't know what to wear."
Stacy," Oh! I know, Hair bows. They're all the rage this days. Just don't wear any feather-earrings, they're so last Tuesday."
Candace," (Puts feather-earrings down) Ah! Yeah, so last Tuesday, Ah hah. I-I would never wear something so Tuesdayish of last."
Phineas," Well, seems the parts didn't arrive for our Zombie-robot pool table. Anybody have any other suggestions?"
Buford," Hey, remember how we did that super Rollercoaster? How 'bout a super duper Rollercoaster?"
Baljeet," So, you are just adding a ""duper"" then?"
Buford, It's an acceptable suffix.
Isabella, We did a Portal to Mars. Maybe...a Portal to Venus?
Baljeet, Hah! Only if they make SPF 12 million.
Buford," Okay-okay! How 'bout a super-super duper-duper-duper Rollercoaster? What, too much or not enough?"
Phineas," Actually, instead of improving one of our old inventions, we should make something brand new! Something simple."
Isabella, How do you mean?
Phineas," Well, what is summer all about?"
"Buford, Isabella, Baljeet"," ♪ Summer is running through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes, and-- ♪"
Phineas," Yeah, we all know the song. (beat) But I'm not exactly sure how...."
Buford," Well, Hurry up and think of somethin', I'm gettin' tired hanging around here."
Phineas," That's it Buford. You can't get more summer than a tire swing. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
Buford," Uh, hatch mosquitoes?"
Phineas, No. Hey! Where's Perry?
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P, We have a report that Doofenshmirtz is at the Shark. We don't know which Shark, but it sounds bad. Ugh! Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it..."
Carl," Sir, it was a typo, Doof isn't at the Shark, he's at the park."
Major Monogram," Well then, that's a lot lower on my heebie-jeebie scale. So Agent P, uh, change of plan. Head over to the park and stop Doof from doing the doings that Doof does ...do (Clears throat)"
Carl," You have a heebie-jeebie scale, sir?"
Major Monogram, Yeah. You're on it.
Phineas, An old-fashioned tire-swing but huge and powered by jet-engines that can flatten a small village. Baljeet have you calibrated the ailerons yet?
Baljeet," Oh sure, calibrated the ailerons..."
Buford, I'll just stay here and fiddle with stuff so I look busy.
Phineas," Hey, Buford."
Buford," What? I didn't take nothing out of nowhere. But, uhm, just as a hypothetical. Uh... What do you think would happen if say you took that goofy doohickey-thing out of the thingamawhatsit?"
Phineas," Hmm... Good question. Ferb? (Opens a blueprint.) Well, if we account for the coolness of the jet propulsion circuits this early in the day and the increased internal humidity while that access port is open, removing the part in question would cause the machine to emit a ray that turns a human into a fly."
Buford, Really?
Phineas," You'd be surprised how often removing a single component can make the difference between one thing and a highly complicated totally unrelated other thing. For instance, if you remove this part it will become a Sorbet machine. Why do you ask?"
Buford," Oh, no reason."
Candace," A hair bow? Only Stacy can pull this off. (Screams) I'm a fly, how is this possible? Phineas and Ferb, you are so buzzzzzzzzted! Mom!"
Candace," Bzzzz! Bzzzzzzz!!! Bzz bzzz bzzzzzz! Bzzzzzz! (close up on fly Candace as she buzzes in her mother's ear) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb invented somethin' that turns people into flies!"
Candace, Bzzzz bzzzzzz!
Linda," Ew, get away, fly! Shoo! Oops! I'm late for my appointment."
Candace," Bzzzzz! Bzzzzz! Mom! It's me! Mom!!! You need to bust the boys and get them to turn me back into me before Jeremy gets back here! (wide shot as Candace realizes she's in the car with Linda, who starts the ignition) What?! (She flies in place but not before smashing into the window) Help meeeeee!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you join me for a picnic? (Perry hesitates but then walks up, but not before sinking into his trap. Doofenshmirtz laughs.) Ah! Ah! Ow, my duodenum. Oh, oh, did you see your face?! You were like, ""Ooh, maybe I shouldn't,"" but you're then, ""Well, I am hungry"" and then BOOM! down you went! Ha-ha! And are you hungry, Perry the Platypus? (Picks up the picnic basket) Well, too bad, it's not for you. It's for them. (Whip pan to reveal pigeons eating seeds. Cut back to Doofenshmirtz, who retrieves an inator from the basket) Behold! My feed-the-pigeons-inator! (Perry just gives Doofenshmirtz a look) Okay, Snobby the Snobapus, I know it doesn't sound like much, but it is technically evil. I am breaking the law. See? (whip pan to a sign saying, ""DO NOT FEED THE PIGEONS!"") There? There. ""Do not feed the pigeons"". And I am going to feed the pigeons, therefore I am breaking the law. ""Do not feed the pigeons"". It's a-it's a metal sign with......big red letters on it and that makes it.......legally binding. (covers his eyes) Okay, here's the truth: I got evil scientist's block, alright? (sighs) Seriously, I got—I got nothing. I—I was going to make a good-idea-inator, but I thought it would be counterproductive because it already had ""good"" in the title. So then I invented a bad-idea-inator, which...just...gave me this. And see where that got me. Ah, I'm telling ya, I'm dry, Perry the Platypus. Dry! And the summer just keeps going on and on and it feels like it's been goin' on for, like, four years! I'm asking ya man to monotreme, can you help me? (Perry comes out of his hole and leads Doofenshmirtz) See? Even my trap design has become...lackluster."
Phineas," Lady and gentlemen, may we present the good old-fashioned new-fashioned tire swing! (Cut to inside the tire swing to reveal Phineas, Isabella, Ferb, Baljeet and Buford inside the tire) Prepare to engage thrusters! (The tire begins swinging back and forth with rocket launchers) The fully-pressurized cabin is gyroscopically balanced for a perfectly smooth ride."
Baljeet, Hmmm. Now it just feels like we are watching a movie.
Phineas," (pushing a red button) True, but we can also go old school! Hang on, everybody!"
Isabella, This is great!
Buford, I have never been so sick to my stomach!!
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I think I've gleaned from your expression that you are now going to lead me through a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated exercises that will help me get my groove back. Does that about sum it up? Good. Let's do this thing!"
Candace, Bzzzz! Bzzzzzz! Bzzz bzz bzzzzz!
Linda," You again? Ha ha! Looks like I took you on a little trip. (opens her window) Get back to your family, little fella."
Candace, Little fella? What of me looks like a little FELLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! (she tumbles out the window)
Candace, (gasp) This is Jeremy's house! And there's Jeremy! At last! A silver lining! I can find out where we're goin' tonight! A girl's gotta know what a girl's gotta wear.
Jeremy," Yeah, it's a total surprise. I'm taking her to the rodeo."
Candace," The rodeo? I love rodeos! Wait, do I love rodeos or is that because I'm a fly?"
Jeremy," Oh, hang on, Coltrane, there's a fly in here. Lemme get it."
Gretchen, There's one!
Holly," C'mon, Fireside Girls!"
Ginger, Let's get it!
Holly," Well, girls, there goes our lizard-feeding patch."
Candace, Zzzzzz...zzzzzz! (she lands on a water spout. Close up as she catches her breath) Could this day get any weirder?
Male Voice, Hello.
Candace," Omigosh, were you turned into a fly, too?"
Human Fly, Who me? No. I was always a fly. I just got shot with a human-head-inator and...now I got this thing! It's really uncomfortable. How do you walk around with these?
Candace, Tell me about it. Be glad you don't have a freakishly long neck! (She buzzes out of frame)
Isabella, That was the most fun ever!
Phineas, Yeah! And let's restock the snack bar and go again!
Baljeet, Now there is something you do not see every day: a fly with orange hair.
Phineas, Orange hair? (takes out a loupe) Uh oh! (POV shot from the loupe to show a really ticked-off Candace fly) Candace has been turned into a fly! (cut back to Phineas) Wait a minute! Did someone take the doohickey out of the thingamawhatsit? (looks aside) Buford?
Buford," Uhhh...oh no! If I catch the mug what did this...Yeah I'm on it! (he walks to the control panel) Okay, I just pull on... (he activates something and a yellow ray shoots out)"
Buford, (offscreen) Whoop! Wrong one!
Buford, (offscreen) Not that one!
Phineas, Wa-wait! Go back two!
Candace," (gasps, happily) Oh thank you thank you thank you thank you! (exits then enters again, angrily) I mean, you are so busted! (exits again, then enters again, happily) But thank you!"
Buford," Took a few tries there! If I weren't thinking, I woulda just pressed this ""fly"" button. (He presses the fly button, causing the giant tire swing to launch, taking the pedestal with it) Oh, that kind of fly!"
Astronaut," Woah, that is so weird! We're in a space shuttle and the shuttle program ended years ago!"
Isabella, I guess that's it. Fun's over.
Phineas, Au contraire. (He pushes a button and the control panel changes into a sorbet machine. He passes out a couple of sorbets to his friends) Sorbet?
Doofenshmirtz," This is great! The best inator I've ever made! And you know what, Perry the Platypus? There's no self-destruct button on this, so there's no way you can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-State— (The giant tire swing lands on his inator before he finishes his statement) Huh. Well, like my Uncle Boris used to say, ""When life's goin' well, a giant tire comes along and smashes your inator."" We all thought he was crazy at the time, but now it seems rather prophetic."
Buford," I don't get why this stuff is called ""sorbet""? Ain't it just a fancy people word for ""ice cream""?"
Ferb," While ice cream is made from dairy products and turned vigorously with air, sorbet is made entirely out of fancy people."
Buford, Really?
Ferb," No, not really."
Jeremy," Hey, guys! (He comes in dressed in his fancy suit) Is Candace around?"
Candace," (offscreen) Hey there, Jeremy! (cut to the sliding door to reveal Candace in a cowgirl outfit, speaking in a western accent) A lil' birdie told me we were goin' to the rodeo!"
Maitre d'," (French accent) Actually, sir, it is pronounced ""ro-day-o""."
Jeremy," Oh, yeah. My mistake."
Maitre d'," (to Candace) May I take your order...""partner""?"
Candace, (sighs) I don't suppose it's Dress Like a Cowboy and Get Your Dinner Free Night.
Maitre d'," No, madame. That is Tuesdays."
