Isabella, ...we're reaching out to everyone to share our love of summer!
Baljeet," Using Ferbographic technology, we are simulcasting our virtual selves around the planet!"
Phineas," To put it simply, we're joining you to celebrate around the world, all from the comfort of our own backyard!"

Phineas," And now help us in welcoming a very special guest and the visual metaphor for the carefree days of summer, Perry the Platypus!"
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Carl," (offscreen) Gosh, sir. I've never been to a cadet graduation before. (Cut to inside the car to reveal Carl driving while Monogram and Perry are in the back.) I hope I'm not underdressed."
Major Monogram," No, you're fine, Carl. Not everything's about you, you know. (A beeping sound is heard. Monogram pushes a button on the TV monitor beneath him and a highly decorated colonel appears onscreen.) Hello, Colonel Contraction."
Colonel Contraction," Greetings, Major! I just wanna wish you good luck on today's event! I've got the cake, and I'll be on my way just as soon as I'm done skimming out my kid's pool."
Major Monogram," Very good, sir. This year's event will be held at the Knights of Danville Hall, Ballroom B."
Colonel Contraction, Ballroom B? Isn't that a shared space?
Major Monogram," Just another money-saving idea of mine, sir."
Colonel Contraction," I don't know, Major. What about security?"
Major Monogram," Oh, don't worry, sir. No one will know it's us. We're registered as the ""Capulet Bat Mitzvah""."
Colonel Contraction," Hmm, well, you have my utmost confidence, Major. But it goes without saying, any mishap could cost you your position. Contraction out!"
Major Monogram," Well, I don't know about you guys, but I've got a good feeling about this!"
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz," (offscreen) Nice goin', Norm! (Cut to backstage where Doof is having a talking-to to Norm.) Next time someone asks for volunteers to host the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Service Awards, say your own name, Mr. Blabbermouth!"
Norm," But, sir, I made all the arrangements for you."
Doofenshmirtz," Yes, and a fine job you did, too. We are sharing the space with another event!"
Norm, What's wrong with that?
Doofenshmirtz," What's wrong with it? Do you realize what would happen if all the other evil organizations found out we were sharing? They'd be all, ""Oh, look! There goes L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! They share! They're cocky and uncoordinated and don't wear name-brand jeans!"" ""Well, maybe people can't afford designer jeans, Julie!"""
Norm," Wow, that was..."
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it."
Norm," Well, don't worry, sir. No one will know it's our event. We're registered as the ""Hatfield Wedding Reception""."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, let's hope nobody knows it's us. (walks off) Now, get out of my way, you perfunctory party planner."
Carl," (offscreen) Sir, may I offer you one of my budget-saver hors d'oeuvres before you go on? It's an old family recipe. Strips of bologna and wadded-up white bread."
Major Monogram, Where exactly are you from?
Carl, Chula Vista.
Major Monogram," Hmmm. Nevermind, Carl. It's showtime! (Cut to the stage) Hello, everyone! Welcome to the O.W.C.A. Graduation Ceremony!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hello, and welcome to L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.'s first annual... (The agents' cheering is still heard. Doof speaks louder.) I said, L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.'s FIRST ANNUAL DISSERVICE AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDS!!! So, who's ready to have some fun?"
Major Monogram," What the heck is all that racket? I'm just gonna go over there and tell them to keep it down. I'll be polite but firm. (He opens the divider to reveal Doof, as a record scratch is heard, then he closes it up again.) Huh. What are the odds?"
Doofenshmirtz," (reopening the divider) Wait, you're the Capulet Bar Mitzvah?"
Major Monogram, You're the Hatfield Wedding?
Major Monogram," Alright, everyone, take it easy. Just calm down. No reason to get upset. We've got a massive security deposit on this place. So, everybody just..."
Parrot, Rawk! Polly wants a streetfight!
Major Monogram, (offscreen) Defenestrate!
Man," Hup! Sorry to interrupt, I'll come back when you're done."
Major Monogram, We are so gonna lose our deposit.
Linda," (offscreen) Here's your stuff from the attic, Candace."
Linda (cont'd), I don't know why you couldn't find it.
Candace," I don't know, Mom. It must've been behind something. Heh heh."
Linda," Candace, you didn't go up there at all, did you?"
Candace," Oh, Mom, I just couldn't go up there. It's all gross and webby."
Linda," Candace Flynn, don't tell me you're still afraid of spiders."
Candace, Pfft! Spiders? Are you kidding? Why would I be afraid of an itsy bitsy SPIDER!??!?! (jumps up to the top shelf) Aah! Ahh! Ew ew ew ew!
Linda," Oh, for crying out loud. It's a hair clip. That looks nothing like a spider."
Candace, (chuckles) I knew that! I'm just showing you how silly it is to be afraid of a little spider.
Linda," Mmhmm. Well, you got your box. Now I have to go."
Candace, Where are you going?
Linda, Your dad and I are going spelunking.
Candace," Spelunking? You mean, like, in a cave?"
Linda, It's a journey of self-discovery while crawling around in a hole. Your dad found it on a group coupon website.
Candace," (sarcastically) Yeah, that sounds fun"
Linda," Just remember, you're in charge, Miss Muffet."
Colonel Contraction," Alright, Major, here's the ca--Oh! (He sees the results of the fight. The whole room is a mess and agents are groaning in defeat.) Ateahoo!"
Major Monogram," (gets up and salutes) Colonel Contraction, sir!"
Colonel Contraction," Major Monogram, I hold you personally responsible for turning one of our most sacred ceremonies into a grade A countrified debacle!"
Major Monogram, Debacle?
Colonel Contraction," DEBACLE! Now normally, I'd be able to forgive this kind of thing because of your tireless dedication and spotless record to OWCA, but it's clear to me that you lost our security deposit and that is something I cannot forgive. I'm forced to relieve you of command. I'll take that... (rips off the first ""M"" on Monogram's uniform) and that! (rips off his mustache)"
Monogram," Actually, sir, that mustache was mine."
Colonel Contraction," Not anymore. (leaves, then reenters) DEBACLE!!! Carl the Intern, until a replacement can be found, (puts mustache on Carl) you are provisionally in charge. (salutes) Congratulations, Provisional Unpaid Major-in-Charge Carl!"
Major-in-Charge Carl," Major, I...I don't..."
Monogram," Carl, be strong. I must step down. We must all do our duty. (The agents hum ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" under this.) And that is what our, I mean, your organization is built upon. People following orders."
Candace," Oh, cool, my old tiara. Ooh, sparkly! (picks up a videocassette) Hey, I don't remember this. Hmm. (reads) ""For: Future Candace!"" Hey, wait a minute! I'm Future Candace! There's gotta be a machine around here that still plays these things."
Candace, Phineas!
Phineas," Oh, hi, Candace! Nice outfit."
Candace, Nice glasses.
Phineas, Thanks! We're using them to simulcast ourselves all around the world.
Candace, Sh-sh-sh-sh! No time! I need to watch this.
Phineas," A videocassette? Wow, going old school, huh?"
Candace, Right? So how do I watch it?
Phineas," Well, Dad has a universal video player in the garage."
Candace, Where in the garage?
Phineas, 12 degrees northwest of the washing machine.
Candace, Thanks. Carry on with your non-bustable activity. (She leaves.)
Phineas," Everyone, give it up for our sister, Candace Flynn!"
Tour Guide, Are you folks ready for a little adventure?
Lawrence," Oh, yes, we're ready for our journey of self-discovery while crawling through the belly of the Earth."
Tour Guide, Say what?
Lawrence," Well, like the ad said, ""Inner Spelunking with Soul""."
Tour Guide," What?! Oh, no, no, no! It's supposed to be ""Saul"", S-A-U-L. That's my name, Saul. There will be absolutely no self-discovery."
Lawrence, Awww.
Linda," You go on and self-discover, hun."
Young Candace," (onscreen) Keep the camera thteady, Thtacy."
Candace," Aw, look, it's me! Aw, I was so cute!"
Young Candace, (on video) Thith ith Candathe Flynn. I'm five yearth old and it wath an awethome thummer! But I didn't get to do everything I wanted. Tho I made a litht of thingth that I want Future Candathe to take care of.
Candace," Oh, that's so cute. Of course, I'll take care of those things, Past Candace!"
Young Candace," (on video) First on the list, invent an ice cream flavor, win a first-grade spelling bee, ride a unicorn. Tho if you're watching, Future Candathe, don't—"
Young Stacy," (offscreen) Candace, don't forget number four, conquer fear of spiders."
Young Candace," (on video) Okay, that one creepth me out a little bit, but that should be no problem for you, Future Candathe!"
Candace," But, but-but-but...But I'm ""Future Candathe""!"
Dr. Doofenshmirtz," Just a minute, I'm mopping. (opens the door) Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus, long time, no see. Say, that was some morning we had, huh? Too bad about Major Monogram, but the show must go on or a bird in the bush, eh-eh, I dunno. (Perry gets trapped in hardening foam.) Ha! You like that? It's a gift...foam-a me to you! Get it? As much as I like our little visits, you didn't need to come over. Actually, I'm not even trying to take over the Tri-State Area today. Y-You see, I have a problem. I am very fair-skinned. I don't know if you have noticed. I always have to use SPF 120 sunscreen even on a cloudy day or I'll burn. I mean, I'll actually burst into flames. And I got this whole crate on sale, and, and look, it's all 110 SPF! I thought I was getting 120! This is not gonna work. So rather than return this whole mess, which means I'd have to get in the car, drive down there, wait in line, then answer a bunch of questions about the delicacy of my epidermis, I'm just gonna move the Earth away from the sun just enough that the 110 will work. Simple. And to that end, I have created, tada, my Shift-The-Earth's-Position-Further-Away-From-The-Sun-inator! Eh? I know. The name's a little cumbersome, but it's basically a tractor beam that uses the mass of Jupiter as an anchor to pull the Earth just slightly away from the sun to render my sunscreen effective. Eh. I guess my fortune cookie was right. I do tend to overcomplicate things. (picks up fortune) I wonder if that means these lottery numbers are--"
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, Hmm? (Perry taps Doof's shoulder and grabs his nose.)
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, Hee hee hee! You fired my inat-- (gets splashed by the wet mop)
Buford, Whoa! What was that?
Phineas, We are rockin' this place!
Phineas,Act 2
Stacy," Candace, what is that?"
Candace," I don't know, but I can guess. (Shouts out the window.) Phineas, what is going on out there?!"
Phineas," I don't know. It wasn't us. But we can find out. Irving, take over the concert for us!"
Irving, All I know how to sing is one camp song.
Isabella," Then you rock that camp song, Irving!"
Irving," Um, okay. Here's a campfire song my mother taught me."
Irving," ♪ Oh, never lick a tree below the dog line, ♪"
Phineas," Well, according to the pocket barometer, the atmospheric pressure has lowered dramatically since this morning."
Buford, You checked the atmospheric pressure this morning?
Phineas, Yeah. I check it every morning. After I brush my teeth.
Buford, You brush your teeth every morning?
Phineas," Well, yeah."
Buford," Huh. (beat, to Baljeet) He thinks he's better than us."
Phineas," Oh, no! Duck! (the gang ducks) No, I mean, like, a whole lot of ducks. Look! (Cut to the sky to reveal a whole lot of ducks flying in their ""v"" formation.) They look like they're migrating south. Guys, I think something's weird with the weather."
Baljeet, We should monitor the conditions in the upper atmosphere. I have a weather balloon.
Buford, Why would you have a weather balloon?
Baljeet," Buford, you have full-sized molds of all of us."
Buford, We should use Baljeet's weather balloon!
Stacy," Wow, I remember this list!"
Candace," Yep, Stace, I promised five-year-old me that I'd do everything on that list."
Stacy," Well, let's see what you gotta do. ""Invent a new ice cream flavor, win a first-grade spelling bee, ride a unicorn, and conquer fear of spiders."" Ha! Good luck with that last one."
Candace, What are you talking about?
Stacy," Candace, everyone knows you're terrified of spiders."
Candace, Pfft. Spiders? Are you kidding? Why would I be afraid of an itsy bitsy SPIDER!?!?!?! AAAH! AHHH! GET IT! GET IT! EW EW EW EW EW!!
Stacy," Oh, I remember this hair clip."
Saul," Most people don't think life can survive down this deep, but most people don't know gastropods the way I do. Take a gander at this salamander. Notice anything unusual?"
Lawrence," Oh, yes, his gills are on the outside of his body."
Saul, They are? Ew! Oh! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Lawrence, (to Linda) It didn't have any eyes either.
Linda, Thanks for not mentioning that.
Computer, You may enter.
Major-in-Charge Carl," (whispering) Psst! Agent P, down here! (Cut to reveal Major-in-Charge Carl hiding in a kennel. Agent P approaches him.) Is that goat still eating out of the inbox? (Perry nods.) It's a good thing I hid the outbox."
Monty, Carl!
Perry, (chatters)
Monty," Oh, Agent P, what's going on? It's like a zoo in here. Where is my dad?"
Major-in-Charge Carl, Your father's been fired.
Monty, Fired? Really?
Major-in-Charge Carl," Yes! And all the animal agents are going crazy! (Monty opens the kennel and Major-in-Charge Carl crawls out.) On the upside, I've been promoted."
Monty," Yes, I see the mustache. (A printer is heard whirring. Monty takes out the paper.) Looks like you got a message."
Major-in-Charge Carl," It's intel from Agent Squab, our French surveillance pigeon. Hmm, there's a small shift in ambient temperature, there's civil unreasonableness at City Hall, and L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. is convening for a secret meeting?! Oh no! Why did this have to happen on my watch?!"
Monty," Wait a minute, you got all that from this?"
Major-in-Charge Carl," Yeah, that's how Agent Squab types, all hunt-and-peck."
Monty," Well, Carl, you're in charge. What are you gonna do about it?"
Major-in-Charge Carl, You mean besides freak out?!
Monty," Get a hold of yourself. You know this agency as well as my dad. Maybe better. These agents just need leadership. Think: ""What Would Major Monogram Do?"""
Major-in-Charge Carl," You're right! (to the goat) Agent G, quit eating those memos and get out into the field! (to the dog) Agent D, go see what you can dig up! (to the owl) Agent O, go find out who's who! Agent Possum, play dead! (Agent Possum does so.) Excellent! (To the bear who is shredding documents) Agent B, go into the woods and...see what's out there! And the rest of you, get out there and fight evil! Agent P, I want you to go out to City Hall and get a reading on the situation there and then report back to me."
Monty," (puts on fedora) What about me, Carl? I can go spy on L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. if you--"
Major-in-Charge Carl," Oh, no, no, Monty. I can't let you do that. That's...that's crazy! You're not even an animal."
Monty," We've got no choice, Carl. We're all gonna have to wear different hats today...and mustaches."
Major-in-Charge Carl," Hey, Monty?"
Monty, What?
Major-in-Charge Carl, Thanks
Monty," No problem. Oh, and, uh, (takes off fedora) can I have a different hat? This one smells like a litter box."
Major-in-Charge Carl," Yeah, you should smell this thing."
Monogram," Morning, your mission today: battle the forces of darkness and keep the Tri-State Area safe from evil-doers."
Driver," Uh, come again?"
Monogram," Oh, sorry. Force of habit. (gives the driver his order) Here's your order. Enjoy your Slushy Dawg. (The driver drives away. Monogram turns to Jeremy.) So, uh, how'm I doin', boss?"
Jeremy," Yeah, this is the part of the job I hate the most, but..."
Monogram," Yep. Say no more, sir. I completely understand. You don't have to fire me. (He takes off his uniform and gives it to Jeremy.) I resign."
Jeremy, But--
Monogram," (leaves, saluting, half-naked) Say no more. (hums)"
Jeremy," But...but... I was just gonna ask him to clean the bathroom. (walks up to a female employee) Um, Dolores, this is the part of the job I hate the most."
Dolores," Oh, for crying out loud, just give me the mop."
Stacy," Okay, let's see. ""Invent a new ice cream flavor."""
Candace, Grilled cheese!
Stacy," Check. ""Win a first grade spelling bee."""
Candace, Clover. C-L-O-V-E-R. Those stupid kids never knew what hit 'em!
Stacy," Check. ""Ride a unicorn.""...Of sorts."
Candace," Dreams can come true, Stacy!"
Stacy, There's just one more thing on the list. Get over your fear of spiders.
Candace," No, I refuse! Quickly, Rainbow, we must away! Fly, now, fly! On, proud beauty! Fly, fly!"
Rainbow, Aw hee haw hee haw hee haw!
Gordon Gutsofanemu," Danville is in chaos. Summer has become slightly cooler. Some sources even go as far as to say, ""brisk"". We have word that the Mayor is about to address this slight drop in temperature. Let's listen."
Roger," (wearing a sweatshirt) Citizens of Danville, I want to assure you that your slight discomfort is of utmost importance to me and I will do everything in my power to...recommend you wear a cardigan or light sweater."
Woman #1, But all my sweaters are ugly and Christmas themed!
Roger," Well, then, just wear warmer clothes."
Man #1," Warmer clothes? Do you know how dumb I would look wearing socks with flip-flops? (to the crowd) Hey, his sweater looks nice and warm. Get it!"
Roger," People, people. Look look look, take-take it easy. I'm still your mayor!"
Roger," Thank you, good Samaritan platypus! (Perry leaves him there.) Although I'm not sure this is much of an improvement. I mean, I really don't know how to get down from here...and it's getting noticeably colder up here. Oh! It's a good thing I wore my sweater."
Baljeet," Well, according to the conditions in the upper atmosphere..."
Baljeet (cont'd), ...we are in for a moderate cold front that shows absolutely no signs of subsiding.
Phineas, That's odd. I can't remember a single Danville summer where I needed to wear anything more than a T-shirt.
Isabella, Striped.
Phineas, And shorts.
Isabella, Blue cargo.
Baljeet," But the part that perplexes me the most is that, for some reason, the sun algorithm that I created keeps coming up with the wrong result!"
Buford, 'Splain?
Baljeet," The diameter of the sun can be calculated from the distance between the Earth and the sun. Since we know the time taken for the Earth to go once around the sun, p=1 year, and the distance traveled by the Earth in this process, 2πa..."
Baljeet, BUFORD!!!
Buford, Stop 'splainin'! Stop 'splainin'!
Isabella, So that would mean the Earth has moved?
Phineas, Apparently so.
Isabella," Well, that would explain why it's noticeably colder. (Cut to Irving still singing)"
Irving, ♪ Your sinew's torn apart by a grizzly... ♪ (shivers) Freezing!
Phineas, I think we're gonna have to run some more tests.
Doofenshmirtz," (offscreen) Now, why do we always have to meet in drafty abandoned warehouses? I mean, why can't we meet in a drafty abandoned poolside cabana?"
Dr. Bloodpudding, Oh ho ho ho! I'm bananas for cabanas!
Dr. Diminutive, Right?
Rodney," Okay, enough of that! Gentlemen, it's time we pooled our resources! Both OWCA and City Hall are in a panic and I believe now is the time to strike! Now, the last time we confronted those OWCA agents, we barely got out of there with our lives! (The villains agree.) It's time to play dirty! We'll stealthily capture them one at a time and imprison them here!"
Villain #1, Yeah!
Villain #2, Gang up on them!
Villain #3, We can make it a musical number!
Rodney," Secondly, no one under any circumstances, is allowed to say ""bananas for cabanas."""
Dr. Bloodpudding, (offscreen) Noted.
Rodney," And third, which one of you moved the Earth away from the sun and changed the weather?"
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, that would be me?"
Rodney, Doofenshmirtz? You've finally made an inator that actually works?
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, all of my inators work! It's just that, you know, I...I don't use them properly. I have poor planning skills. (takes out blueprints) But it was me. I've the blueprints right here. (The villains all look in amazement.) Yeah, you see, just ignore the coffee stain or whatever that is. (sniffs) Uh, I think that's nacho cheese."
Rodney," Gentlemen, we will now begin our takeover of...the world!"
Monty," (gasps, then covers his mouth)"
Rodney, What was that?
Dr. Diminutive, (offscreen) Maybe the building's settling.
Rodney," (offscreen) So to you, a building settling sounds like someone inhaling sharply?"
Dr. Diminutive," (offscreen) Well, I live in a strange building."
Monty, I've got to warn Carl.
Rodney," (offscreen) Okay, tell me you didn't hear that!"
Dr. Diminutive, (offscreen) Still the building settling.
Rodney, (offscreen) So our building has a sudden urge to warn Carl?
Stacy," (offscreen) Come on, Candace!"
Stacy (cont'd), It's the last thing on the list.
Candace," I know I know I know I know okay, here I go! (Walks in nervously.) Ugh! I can't!"
Stacy, I don't understand what the big deal is.
Candace, It's just the legs and the hair and all those eyes! And why do they have so many eyes?!
Stacy," There's nothing to be afraid of. Spiders are harmless. (opens a cage) Look. I'm sticking my hand in the cage. Hello there, little guy. (gets bitten) Huh!"
Candace," Poor Stacy. My fear of spiders got Stacy bitten. (happily) But saved me! Yes! Looks like it's just you and me now, Rainbow."
Rainbow, Aw hee haw hee haaaaawwww!
Phineas," Alright, Isabella, let me have it one more time."
Isabella," Well, according to our data, this is the relative position of the sun, and this is where the Earth should be on its orbit this summer. But for some reason, we're here. (sighs) Tennis balls don't lie. (Throws the ball.)"
Phineas, Every test scenario we run comes back with the same results. It just seems impossible. (throws the ball to Baljeet)
Baljeet, Aaah! But it is true! The Earth has moved away from the sun and now summer is gone!
Buford, Big deal! So this summer's over. There's always next summer.
Phineas," No, Buford. If we don't do something soon, summer will be gone forever!"
Ferb, What? I'm expressing how I feel through music.
Ferb,Act 3
L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.," ♪ Evil team up, ♪"
Buford, And that's what would happen if we grew magnets under the Earth's core.
Phineas, The credits were a nice touch.
Buford," Well, there's so many people behind the scenes that deserve a mention."
Phineas, I guess that's another course of action that's off the table. (crosses off a formula on the blackboard) Not too many ideas left.
Isabella, (shudders) But we have to figure out a way to save summer or it'll be gone forever!
Phineas," Well, Baljeet, what have you got?"
Baljeet, I have composed a simulation for turning the Earth's core into a gyroscope. Maybe that would... (groans)
Buford, And roll credits!
Ferb, Sure hope this cold weather isn't affecting Mum and Dad's cave adventures.
Saul," Okay, now we're gonna squeeze past this stalactite... I mean, stalagmite. Wait, which one is on top?"
Lawrence," Actually, I believe that's just a hole."
Saul," I seem to be trapped! Turn away, folks! I'm gonna have to saw my arm off!"
Saul," That was a close one. Now, follow me!"
Linda," Do you get the feeling that this might be his first time down here, too?"
Saul," (offscreen, grunts as his light suddenly goes out) Dangit!"
Rodney," There we go! With that, we've captured all of OWCA's agents."
Doofenshmirtz, Almost all of them. Remember Perry the Platypus. He's still out there somewhere.
Rodney," Thank you for reminding me, Dr. Bringdown."
Villain #4," Excuse me, I'm Dr. Bringdown!"
Rodney," Put a sock in it, David! (to Doof) Time to get to our press conference! Soon, the world will bow to us, like Doofy's neck bows to his back."
Dr. Diminutive, His posture's poor.
Doofenshmirtz, Nice.
Rodney," Come on, Slouchy! Let's make ourselves some demands!"
Candace," Hey there, little fella. You're not such a tough guy, are you, Mr. Spider? Aw, no you're not. No, not a bit. Ah, who ya kidding, Flynn? To face your fear, you gotta at least look. (gets creeped out by the spider) Ahh! Creepy crawly, creepy crawly, creepy crawly! Get off me, get off me, get off me, get off me! Ew, ew! I'm sorry, 5-year-old me. I tried. I really tried. (slaps herself) Snap out of it, current me! Summer's not over yet. (looks outside the window) Hey, wait a minute, summer's over? Who did th- oh... Phineas and Ferb. (runs downstairs) Phineas and Ferb, what did you do to summer?!"
Man #2, Your fall is ruining summer.
Woman #2, You made me buy a blanket with sleeves!
Man #3, My toilet seat's cold.
Doofenshmirtz," Ladies and gentlemen of the press, kindly put a cork in it. So you've probably figured out that the Earth has moved away from the sun."
Rodney," And we at L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. are responsible. And now, we're here to extort you. And to that end, let me introduce you to Señor Killbot."
Dr. Killbot," ¿Donde esta la biblioteca? (""Where is the library?"")"
Rodney," You know, in case any of you extortees speak Español. We don't want to leave anyone out."
Dr. Killbot," ¿Qué te parece mi bordado? (""Do you like my embroidery?"")"
Audience, Awwww...
Female," Aw, that's cute."
Doofenshmirtz," And that's our new logo. Foreboding, yet comforting. So basically, if you want us to put the Earth back in its proper orbit, you have to meet our list of demands. Number 1: the minimum height to get on any rollercoaster will now be this high. (puts his hand three inches over Dr. Diminutive's head) (Diminutive puts Doof's hand on the very top of Diminutive's head) I mean that high. Number 2: pretzels."
Rodney, Really? That's how you give demands?
Doofenshmirtz, What? What was wrong with that? I was gonna go for one of those big tubs from Lotsmo.
Rodney, You sounded like a bashful Santa Claus pitching softballs to a girl in a bikini.
Doofenshmirtz," Alright, number four... Wait, you don't know what that sounds like!"
Rodney," Stand aside. (pushes Doof away from the podium) Listen, you dogs, with one small inator..."
Doofenshmirtz, My inator!
Rodney," ...we've moved the Earth into an early autumn. Now, we, the collective scientific genius of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., have created an inizer ten times the size and strength! Capable of moving the Earth so far away from the sun, we'll bring about a new ice age! So, if you value your puny lives, you will meet all the demands on our list or pay the consequences!"
Doofenshmirtz, Is it just me or is this getting out of hand?
Dr. Killbot," Quiera lucha tu casa. (""I want to fight your house."")"
Dr. Killbot,Act 4
Candace, Seriously? Someone moved the Earth and it wasn't you?
Phineas," Not this time, no."
Candace, Any chance it could spontaneously go back to the way it was?
Phineas," We can't take that chance, Candace. We'll never have another summer if our plan doesn't work."
Candace, Plan? What plan?
Phineas, We're building this massive rocket engine to put on top of Mount Danville.
Candace," One measly rocket on one mountain isn't going to move the Earth, Phineas."
Phineas," (pointing to a splitscreen monitor) That's why we enlisted the help of other kids around the world. See? There's Floria and Abdul on Mount Kilimanjaro, Ganesh and Kabul on Mt. Everest, Vsevolod and Vanko at the top of Mount Elbrus, and Lupert and Eporwold on Mount Haggenhuge. Eporwold's the goat. While they finish fine-tuning, we'll move our rocket up to Mount Danville."
Candace," Then everyone turns them on, and the Earth goes back to the way it was?"
Phineas," Sort of. But the burners all need to be synchronized through this control panel. Otherwise, we risk ripping the Earth's crust apart. Do you think you could stay here and help control the thrust?"
Candace, These look like simple level controls.
Phineas," Yeah. Pretty much the same as a sound mixer, except this one controls five megarockets capable of ripping the Earth in half."
Candace, Why can't Irving do it?
Phineas," Oh, he would, but he's trending right now."
Irving," ♪ Scorpions, parasites, black widows, rabies! ♪"
Major-in-Charge Carl," (offscreen) Good morning, Agent P."
Major-in-Charge Carl," (different inflection) Good morning, Agent P. (to Agent P) Well, what do you think?"
Monty," Carl, the evil scientists of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. have captured all of our agents!"
Major-in-Charge Carl, Ugh! My first day on the job and all my agents get captured! W-What am I gonna do?
Monty," Simple, let's go get 'em!"
Major-in-Charge Carl, But we're seriously outnumbered!
Monty," Maybe, but we have the advantage! We have the best agent with us and we have the element of surprise! We can't lose!"
Major-in-Charge Carl," You're right! Perry, Monty, let's go rescue our agents! (They leave, but Major-in-Charge Carl tries it again with a different inflection in the mirror.) Let's go rescue our agents. Let's go... (Perry comes back with his hands on his hips.) Oh, I'm coming."
Candace," Oh, there's Kilimanjaro! Phineas, Floria and Abdul's rocket is ready! That's all of them!"
Phineas," (on radio) Great! (cut to outside where the rocket goes out for liftoff) Okay, Candace, we're on our way to Mount Danville! Lock down the capsule and stand by!"
Candace," Oh, I sure hope there aren't any spiders in here."
Phineas," Okay, Ferb, let's put it down right there!"
Phineas," C'mon, everyone! Let's get this thing online!"
Isabella, (opening up a laptop) I'm linking up to the other rockets. Is everyone ready out there? Mount Elbrus?
Vanko, (on laptop) Check.
Isabella, Mount Kilimanjaro?
Abdul, (on laptop) Check.
Isabella, Mount Everest?
Kabul, (on laptop) Check.
Isabella, Mount Haggenhuge? (no response) Mount Haggenhuge?
Eporwold, (bleats on laptop)
Isabella," Uh-oh! Mount Haggenhuge, your rocket has gone offline! Can you fix it?"
Isabella, All systems are green!
Phineas, (on radio) Check! Firing up Mount Danville!
Isabella," Okay, Candace..."
Isabella, (on radio) ...you're good to go!
Candace," Roger! Target destination activated! Engaging thrusters! (She slides the switches up and all the rockets fire up.) Phineas, it's working! The Earth is moving back into position!"
Phineas," Fantastic, Candace! Just a couple more minutes and we'll have our summer back!"
Rodney," Well, that was fun. (closeup to reveal Rodney and Doof carrying the grilled cheese flavored ice cream cones.) We should go get ice cream more often."
Doofenshmirtz," Didja have to order for all of us, Rodney? I'm not crazy about this new grilled cheese flavor."
Rodney, You get what you get and you don't get upset!
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, he's strict!"
Rodney," I think we've given our world leaders enough time. Let's see if they submitted to our list of demands! (He activates the screen and several world leaders, including a dolphin, a Scottsman, a Japanese delegate, President Barack Obama, and a female Indian delegate appear onscreen.) Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?"
President Obama," Uh...you'll be happy to know that we've...uhhhh...met all of your demands, except for the...uhhhhhhh....pretzel thing."
Rodney, What?! How dare you!! Do you know what this means?!
President Obama," Look, we're sorry. Uh...We had them, but the Vice President left the tub on the roof of the car, and we...uhhhhhhhh..."
Rodney," No pretzels, no deal!"
Rodney, (offscreen) You have doomed the Earth to perpetual winter!
Candace," Uh, Phineas, the holographic thingy shows that the Earth is moving in the wrong direction!"
Phineas," Well, that makes no sense. It should be working."
Candace, Maybe it needs more power. I'm increasing the burn!
Phineas," No, Candace, don't!! Never push it into the red! That's a bad thing!! Turn down the thrusters!!!"
Buford, This must be a special episode. He's yelling at his sister again.
Candace," Uh, Phineas, what happened?"
Phineas, You must have overloaded the power relay on the control panel. You're gonna have to get a spare electromagnetic coupling fuse.
Candace, (on radio) Where would I find a thing like that?
Phineas, Ferb has one in a box in the attic.
Candace, (on radio) The attic?! Where all the spiders are?!
Phineas," Yeah, the attic."
Candace, (offscreen) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!
Dr. Diminutive, That's just the building settling again.
Dr. Diminutive,Act 5
Rodney, (offscreen) Now the world knows that L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.'s not an organization to be trifled with!
Doofenshmirtz," (offscreen) Yeah, meanwhile, you may have plunged the Earth into another ice age."
Rodney, The world is ours for the taking!
Doofenshmirtz," But this is crazy talk! I-I'm an evil scientist, not a mad scientist! Th-There's a difference! Subtle, I grant you, but, still, y'know, I don't really like the new direction this organization is taking and I think we need a little fresh air. (he walks out)"
Rodney," You also need a chiropractor, Slouchy!"
Dr. Diminutive, Good one! Because he slouches!
Monogram," And as an agent, you get to wear a nifty fedora. I made that one out of an old newspaper. Yes, sir, OWCA is perfect for a guy like you, but-but, sadly, not for me."
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, things are tough all over, bub."
Monogram, What? Doofenshmirtz?!
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, do...do I know you? (Monogram puts two fingers on his nose where his mustache once was.) Major Monogram? Francis, what happened to you? Look...y-y-y-you're a washed-up mess! This whole weather thing is your fault, you know!"
Monogram, My fault?!
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, technically, it's my fault. But if you weren't sitting around in a cold alley whining to rats and feeling sorry for yourself, this whole situation wouldn't have gotten so out of control! Before, I was a regular evil scientist, and now, suddenly, I'm part of this big organization of supervillains bent on world domination! I'm not comfortable with that! The point is you should've been there to stop me! And you weren't! (He puts two pennies into Monogram's tin cup and walks away.)"
Monogram," (picking up the cup) Huh, two cents."
Monty, There's the warehouse!
Major-in-Charge Carl, Come on!
Major-in-Charge Carl," (grunts) Oh! Guys, little help?"
Monty," What do you say, Perry? Think we can take 'em? (Perry and Monty run up to the goons.) Alright, you goons! (Two more goons appear behind the first two goons.) (to Perry) You take two and I'll take two. (Giant footsteps are heard, which is, clearly, not good news.) Great. They have a cave troll. Run!"
Monty," Perry, split up!"
Monty," Thanks, Carl."
Monty," Wow, good work, Agent P!"
Major-in-Charge Carl, Great! Now we get all his health!
Monty," You play way too many video games, man."
Candace," Come on, Candace, you can do this! What's a couple little spiders compared to the fate of the world? (climbs back down) Oh, who am I kidding?! I need support! (She dials her phone.) Stacy, I really need your help!"
Stacy," (on phone) Sorry, Candace, no can do."
Stacy, I have to stay put until the swelling goes down.
Candace, (on phone) Are you okay?
Stacy," I'll be fine. But until then, you're on your own."
Candace," (hangs up) Well, she's no help. I'm gonna have to do this myself. (climbs back up) It's just you and me, attic. You and me... (climbs back down) and about TEN HUNDRED GAZILLION SPIDERS!! OH, I CAN'T DO THIS!!!"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I've had time to think it over and we need to put the world back. I, for one, do not want to live in a perpetual winter! (pushes Rodney) Scoot over, Rodney."
Rodney," Your betrayal doesn't surprise me, Heinz. (pushes Doof) Step aside!"
Doofenshmirtz, (fighting over the controls) Wh-What are you doing?
Rodney," Just to show you who's boss, I'm going to move the Earth even further from the sun!"
Candace," There's Ferb's box way over there. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't go way over there!"
Phineas, Candace?
Candace," AAAAAAHHH! Phineas, how did you get up here?"
Phineas, I'm using the Ferbographic technology.
Phineas, What's taking so long? Did you find the box?
Candace," Well, it's right over there by all those spider webs. Be a pal and grab it for me, will ya?"
Phineas," What? No, I can't pick it up. I'm a hologram. You have to do it."
Candace, But I can't!
Phineas," Well, what's the matter, Candace?"
Candace, It's my fear of spiders. I've been trying to overcome it all day.
Phineas," Well, that is a valid fear. You should be cautious around some spid—"
Candace," Phineas, you're not helping!"
Phineas," Come on, you've already done so many brave things. Remember when you helped us recuse Klimpaloon? And what about that time you got that really big bird to quit pecking our house? Or when you climbed up on the motor of our baguette boat after I gave you a similar pep talk?"
Candace," Yeah! You know what? You're right. (Climbs all the way up.) If I could do that, then I should be able to walk across the attic, right? It's being silly. Heck, I don't even remember what I was afraid of."
Phineas, Spiders.
Candace, AAAAH!!! (climbs back down)
Phineas," Candace, you forgot the box!"
Monty, There they are! They're headin' for the roof! We gotta get up there and stop them from firing that inator!
Dr. Diminutive," (with a pistol) Not so fast, Monty Monogram!"
Monty," Take it easy, we don't want any (attempts to punch but misses) TROUBLE! (backs away) What?"
Dr. Diminutive," Now that we have all of OWCA's agents, nothing can stop us!"
Monogram, (offscreen) That's where you're wrong! (emerges from the shadows)
Major-in-Charge Carl, Major Monogram!
Monogram," I'm back! And I brought some help! (Agent Rat appears on his shoulders and whistles, followed by all of the escaped OWCA agents.)"
Dr. Killbot," ¡Qué lástima! (""What a Pity!"")"
Dr. Diminutive, Wait a minute!!! (record scratch) This is the same brawl we had earlier!
Dr. Bringdown, So?
Dr. Diminutive," Aw, I'm just sayin'."
Dr. Killbot," La cabeza de medusa no es agradable para ver. (""Medusa's head is pleasant to look at."")"
Villain #5, He's right! Let's get out of here!
Villain #6," That's not what he said, but...yes, we should get out of here."
Phineas," Candace, you're not giving up, are you?"
Candace," No. (climbs back up) Today, I face my fear! Back off, spiders! Candace is in the attic!"
Phineas, (offscreen) Now we're talking!
Candace," Ha! Take that, you little... (Several more spiders crawl down from inside the umbrella.) AAAAHHH!!!"
Phineas," Wow, I guess there are a lot of spiders up here."
Phineas," It's all right, Candace. You're just gonna have to reach past that spider."
Candace, Are you kidding me?!
Phineas," Candace, the fate of the world is at stake!"
Candace," Okay, five-year-old me. Here we go. (She timidly sticks her hand into the box, only hesitating for about a second.) Gotta reach it! (The spider sticks out one of its legs.) A little...bit...further! (She grabs the fuse.) That's it! I got it!"
Phineas," Great work, Candace! You go down and put the fuse in, I'll go back and tell the guys! (The hologram disappears, and then reappears.) And well done! (The hologram disappears again.)"
Candace," In your face, arachnid!"
Phineas," Candace did it, Isabella! She got the fuse!"
Isabella," Um, Phineas, one of the main locking bolts came loose on the rocket, and, uh..."
Phineas," Huh. Yeah, we should probably fix that before Candace puts the fuse back."
Rodney," Oh, this is just ridiculous! You and I should just... (points somewhere) Oh, look! A Horse in a Bookcase!"
Doofenshmirtz, A what?
Rodney, Ha! Now to move the Earth into a new ice age!
Candace," Why isn't this thing going in? What is it? ""Righty-loosey, tighty-whitey?"""
Buford," Phineas, this thing ain't budgin'!"
Phineas, Candace? Candace? (to Isabella) Why isn't this com-link working?
Isabella, The rocket is blocking the signal! We've got to get up there!
Rodney, There. I've disabled the reverse switch and the self-destruct button. So there's no—
Doofenshmirtz," Nobody messes with my self-destruct button! (He sticks the mop's handle into the inizer and tries to lift it up.) You make a pretty good fulcrum there, Rodney."
Isabella," Well, at least we're out of danger."
Phineas, We've gotta get the rocket in position or the planet could be torn apart!
Candace," C'mon, you stupid thing! Get in there!"
Candace, It's in!
Candace," (on radio) The fuse is in! Okay, I'm gonna fire up the engines!"
Candace," It's not moving, Phineas! It's like something's resisting our jets!"
Phineas," I was afraid of that! Listen, push the rockets up..."
Phineas, (on radio) ...above the red line!
Candace," But, Phineas, you said that would be bad!"
Phineas," (on radio) Well, there is a..."
Phineas, ....slight chance of pulling the planet apart!
Candace, That's a bad thing!
Phineas," It's our only chance, Candace! We should be okay if we just do it slow and steady!"
Candace," Oh, just like the rabbit in the story."
Phineas," Yes, exact— Wait, no! Like the turtle! Like the turtle!"
Candace, Slow and steady. Slow and steady. (She pushes the levers up slow and steady into the red and the rockets get more powerful.)
Major-in-Charge Carl," Look, Doofenshmirtz is trying to destroy the inator!"
Monogram, Come on! He needs help!
Major-in-Charge Carl," Hang on, sir!"
Monty," Nice catch, Carl!"
Roger, I don't know what's going on anymore.
Candace," Phineas, what's happening?"
Phineas," Unless I've missed my guess, the Earth is moving again! You better shut down the rockets, Candace!"
Candace, Gotta get to the controls! Almost th— AAHHH! (She falls over backwards.)
Phineas," It stopped. We're not moving anymore! Candace, you did it!!"
Candace," What? I did? (She gets up to see that she pulled the plug.) Oh, what do you know? I did it! (She opens the door and smiles as she sees the snow melting.) Aw, summer. Welcome back! (The inator lands in the backyard and takes the control panel with it.) Yeah. Well, that's to be expected."
Monty," Come on, Roddenstein! You're comin' with me!"
Rodney," (to Doof) See ya later, Slouchy!"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, well y— Ugh! I can never come up with anything quick enough!"
Monogram," Doofenshmirtz, you just saved the world. Thank you."
Doofenshmirtz," You're welcome, Francis. Put 'er there! (Monogram holds his hand out, but Doof pulls his away) Psych! (laughs) I'm still evil! (walks away laughing)"
Monogram," Yes. Yes, you are."
Colonel Contraction," Well, Monogram, nice work."
Monogram," Thank you, sir."
Colonel Contraction," Unfortunately, we're still not getting our deposit back on that rental hall and that's really broken the budget. I'm afraid we have to close OWCA."
Major-in-Charge Carl," Sir, why don't you start a new agency?"
Monogram, Good idea! What do we call it?
Major-in-Charge Carl," (checks his phone) Oh, looks like the name ""OWCA"" just became available! Oh, and so did their old building!"
Monogram, Great! We'll call our new organization that and move there!
Major-in-Charge Carl," Good idea, sir!"
Monogram," And to keep costs down, we're gonna have to cut some management positions. Colonel Contraction, your services will no longer be required."
Colonel Contraction," Yeah, well, that's to be expected."
Carl," I think this belongs to you, sir."
Major Monogram," You keep that one, Carl. (He concentrates and instantly grows back his mustache.)"
Carl," Welcome back, sir."
Lawrence, Everything's all right. We're all outside.
Saul," Oh, sweet sunshine! (kneels to the ground) Terra firma!"
Lawrence," Yes, well..."
Saul, (kisses the ground) Lovely top soil!
Lawrence," We'll, uh, just be going then, shall we?"
Linda," Bye, Saul!"
Saul, Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Ugh! Kissed a bug!
Phineas," There she is, the hero of the day! Nice going, Candace! Hey, where'd the command center go?"
Candace, Probably the same place the last one went.
Baljeet," You really did a good job, Candace."
Candace," Yeah, and not only did we save the world, but I did everything I promised five-year-old me I'd do!"
Buford, Let's all pretend like we understood that!
Phineas," Well, now that we have summer back, what should we do?"
Buford, Oh! Oh! I got an idea!
