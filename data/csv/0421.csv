Phineas," Ferb, we've got a lot of leftover parts from the last time we used leftover parts. There must be something we can do with them, you know, besides hodgepodges or art pieces."
Buford," Whoa, dudes, what's with all the junk in your backyard? It's like an obstacle course back here!"
Phineas, That's it! I know what we're gonna do today!
Buford, What'd I say?
Phineas," You said obstacle course, of course!"
Buford," Oh, I meant to say chili cook off."
Baljeet, Are you meaning to tell me we have never made an obstacle course this entire summer?
Phineas, Ferb?
Ferb, I'm filled with remorse
Ferb,"That we haven't, of course,"
Ferb,Even thought of building an obstacle course.
Phineas, Then let's build one and make it our new tour de force!
Ferb, That is a plan I can clearly endorse.
Phineas, Of course!
Baljeet, Of course!
Phineas, Of course!
Buford, Of course! I'm puttin' an end to this before it breaks into song! Where's Perry??
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P. There are pretty suspicious goings-on...going on at the Doofenshmirtz building. We have reports that the building has been rotating all morning, so either he's got something evil up his sleeve, or he's turning it into an expensive romantic restaurant with an impressive view...in which case, I would like a reservation for 6:00 pm. Either way, I'm gonna need you to get over there. (Perry leaves. Monogram looks aside.) Okay, he's gone. One, a-two, a-one-two-three. (Puts on a Major-General's hat and several agents appear and he sings to the tune of ""The Major-General's Song"" from The Pirates of Penzance.)"
Candace," Wow, Gluttony Games is totally bloated with mindless mayhem! And the two girls, they were so brave and fearless!"
Stacy," We would make an awesome team, you and me!"
Candace," (high fives Stacy) You and me, baby! Of course, we'd have to learn to shoot a bow and arrow, and build a rope bridge..."
Candace," ...and catch two leaves between two pieces of wax paper and choose matching backpacks and sharpen a hatchet, (opening the gate) and we'll live on nothing but—"
Candace and Stacy, Holy cannoli!
Candace, What in the world is going on here?! PHINEAS AND FERB!!!!
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, babies and slightly smaller babies, welcome to the Phineas and Ferb Ultimate Obstacle Course! The first team that makes it all the way to the end (you know, alive and stuff) will win this nifty trophy! So are you ready to get muddy?"
Candace, That tears it! Those two are so—
Stacy," Hang on, Candace! We can win this!"
Candace," Yeah, we ca— Wait, what?"
Stacy, I want that trophy!
Candace, Why?
Dr. Hirano," Very good, Ginger. We'll put it up here with the rest of your awards. I'm...still saving a place for your trophy, Stacy. You know, just in case."
Stacy, Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Stacy," ...hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... Candace, we'd make an awesome team!"
Candace," Alright, I'll do it!"
Stacy, For the trophy!
Candace, And for whatever it was you were thinking about just now.
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm, I wonder who that could be. (opens the door and gasps) Perry the Platypus? Well, come on in. Wipe your feet if you don't mind. I just mopped the floor. (Perry steps onto the welcome mat, which traps him.) Ha ha! Gotcha! That's what you get for having manners! Hee hee hee! Now, I bet you're wondering why my building has been turning 90 degrees every now and then. Well, that's because I was just testing out my 90-Degree-Turn-inator!! Eh, you like it? Y'know, it turns things. But only 90 degrees at a time. You see, back in Drusselste—y'know what? Just watch this documentary."
Newsreader," This Week in History! Dateline: 1602. The mayors of Gimmelshtump and Stumblegimp prepare to sign a treaty declaring they are sister cities. However, while reaching for his quill, the Mayor of Gimmelshtump accidentally turned 90 degrees. Since showing your side to another is considered a Stumblegimpian insult, the Mayor of Stumblegimp was forced to follow tradition. (The Mayor of Stumblegimp takes off his shoe and sock and slaps it in the Mayor of Gimmelshtump's face.) And so, war was declared. Gimmelshtump had no choice but to retaliate. The war escalated and raged on for 50 years. Finally, the only way to end this senseless feud was for the Mayor of Gimmelshtump to perform the Stumblegimpian humiliating Dance of Contrition."
Newsreader,You think I will speak French?! I will not speak French!
Newsreader,Nein!
Newsreader," And so, the Mayor of Stumblegimp was appeased. And, once again, all was right between the two cities...or was it? The End!"
Doofenshmirtz," And the Stumblegimp Humiliating Dance of Contrition is just as much a tradition now as it was in the '40s...when this newsreel was made about the 1600s. You see, Perry the Platypus, my brother, the Mayor's gonna meet the present day Mayor of Stumblegimp. And I plan to zap Roger with my 90-Degree-Turn-inator. It will turn him 90 degrees, which will insult Mayor...uh...Whatshisname. Something with waffles. He'll have to sing that whole song, and when the people of Danville see him eat a featherbed or put a donut in his pants, he'll be forced to step down as mayor and I will step into his place, 100% donut-pant-free! Unless, you know, something like last week happens again."
Phineas," And finally, our third team, Candace and Stacy!"
Candace, We are so ready!
Isabella, What was that about?
Ginger," Oh, that's our secret code for ""I love you, sis""...I think."
Phineas," Good luck, contestants! And watch out for giant worms! On your marks..."
Candace," Wait, what?"
Phineas, Get set...
Candace," Did he say, ""Giant worms""?"
Phineas, Go!
Buford, Aaaah! Giant worm!!!
Phineas," Well, it looks like Buford and Baljeet are out of the race. Sorry, guys. You know what they say: Giant worms can do whatever they want."
Phineas," Both remaining teams have made it to the beach! Nice job, ladies, but you may wanna get to cover."
Candace, Cover?
Phineas, (activating a water balloon launcher) Fire!
Isabella, Incoming!
Stacy, Water balloons!
Phineas, Just look at them go!
Stacy, Get off the beach! Get off the beach!!
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, yes! The horse-drawn coach has arrived and Mayor...Wafflesomething is walking up to Roger."
Roger," Heheh, Mayor Chickenen, it is so good to finally meet you."
Doofenshmirtz," Chicken and waffles! That's why I had ""waffles"" stuck in my head. That was it. (walks up to the inator) And...now! (fires the inator)"
Roger, (holding out his hand) It is indeed a rare pleasure to— (He gets zapped and rotates 90 degrees east.)
Mayor Chickenen, Huh? What is the meaning of this? I will have to declare war now!
Roger, Maybe not. Pstt!
Melanie, What happened?
Roger, Get the Dance of Contrition team out here pronto!
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, baby! It worked! And now for the humiliatioooonnnn!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, th-th-th-that's not the Stumblegimp Humiliating Dance of Contrition! (he lowers his hands to reveal there's nothing in them and sighs) One day, I gotta ask Norm what he did with my binoculars."
Phineas, It looks like Isabella and Ginger are way out front!
Candace," Hurry, Stace! They're getting away!"
Phineas," Watch your step, ladies! That's mud down there! Baljeet's suggestion!"
Buford, Really?
Baljeet, I knew we would not make it that far.
Buford," Well, not with an attitude like that!"
Candace," We'll see who gets mud in his face, Smart Guy! (She starts to step on a platform, but it moves and she falls downs screaming and lands with a splat.)"
Phineas, Good thing mud's good for the skin!
Candace, Blehhhhh...
Phineas," (next to a giant fan) Let's dry 'em off, Ferb!"
Isabella," Hold on to something, Ginger! We're almost there!"
Candace," Hey, he's right, my skin feels so soft. Come on, Stace!"
Phineas, Whoa! Nice hang time!
Isabella, I regret nothing!
Candace, That puts us in the lead! Woohoo! (A pie flies into her face.) Pie? Really?
Phineas, And Isabella and Ginger take the lead!
Mayor Chickenen, Wonderful! The new improved Dance of Contrition always makes me want to shake a leg!
Roger, Fantastic.
Doofenshmirtz, Whoa whoa whoa! That was not nearly humiliating enough! Where was the part about bowing and pulling your shirt up over your face and juggling piglets? Where were the piglets?!
Mayor Chickenen," Oh, we haven't done that since the '40s when we made that newsreel about the 1600s. Things have changed. (He hums and dances.)"
Doofenshmirtz, So what's your point?
Phineas," We're nearing the finish line, and here comes Team Ginger and Isabella, with Candace and Stacy in hot pursuit! And now, ladies, who's up for some popcorn?"
Candace, We're the last ones standing!
Candace and Stacy, Yay!
Stacy, Woohoo!
Phineas," Candace and Stacy win! (A giant gorilla hand appears out of nowhere and slaps them off the log.) Sorry. Forgot about the giant gorilla hand. My bad. Remember, everyone's a winner, but only one team gets a trophy!"
Candace," Stacy, we won!"
Ginger," Congratulations, Stacy!"
Stacy, Ha! Now I'm like you! I have a trophy!
Ginger," But, Stacy, I won all those trophies just trying to impress you."
Stacy, Really?
Ginger, Yeah! You're the coolest big sister a girl could ever have! How can I compete?
Stacy," Well, I am pretty cool."
Buford, I'll take that! Giant worms can do whatever they want! (They disappear.)
Candace," (stands up) That does it, it's busting time!"
Candace, (in a stern voice) Mother? May I please speak with you?
Linda," (flatly) Oh, boy..."
Mayor Chickenen," Oh, how rude! (Takes off his shoe and sock and slaps the sock onto Doofenshmirtz.)"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, give it a rest! (grunts) I must've left it in random fire mode."
Pilot," Uh, welcome to Flight J2261 to New York. (The ray bounces off the plane, which rotates 90 degrees.) Uh, hey, who wants to go to Alabama?"
Candace, Mom! (closes eyes) Take a look outside the window!
Linda," Candace, what's gotten into you?"
Candace, Look!!!
Linda," (turns around and sees the image of Phineas and Ferb under the tree outside) Hi, boys!"
Candace, (her eyes open) What...? (looks out the window) But-but -- !
Linda," Really, Candace? This is getting old. (walks away)"
Candace, But....but......but....
