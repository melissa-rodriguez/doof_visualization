Lawrence, (from inside) Nice to see you boys down here at the shop!
Phineas, Wow! What's that thing?
Lawrence," Oh, this? It's an escape chamber from an old vaudeville show. In the old days, men would go into these things and pretend to be locked inside and then they would ""escape"" to the amazement of the crowd. Here, let me show you. (goes inside the chamber) You see? All you need to do is just... (tries to escape) Uh.... Hmm..."
Phineas," You need a little help, Dad?"
Lawrence," Well, no, no, I just need to, um... Oh! (Ferb helps him out) There we go. Thanks, son."
Lawrence," Well, I've got bottle caps to polish. (walks away) Hmhm!"
Phineas, (at Ferb) Dude! I know what we're gonna do today!
Linda," Oh, no. I'm late for my introduction to ice sculpture. (Writes a note and goes outside to Candace sleeping on the hammock) I suppose there's no need to wake her. (puts the note on her head, then leaves)"
Candace, (snoring)
Candace, (mumbling in sleep) Where's Perry?
Carl, And the salad fork is the one on the outside.
Major Monogram, (holding a clipboard and pen) And you're certain of that... (Perry's chair slides forward) Ah! Agent P!
Major Monogram," As you may know, this is International Good Manners Day. Perhaps, not ironically, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has chosen this very week to create a device that causes rampant rudeness. Go take care of it."
Major Monogram, If you please.
Carl, (while Perry leaves his lair) I bet he calls it the Rude-inator.
Major Monogram, What does that make you? Nostradamus?
Phineas," Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! My brother and I are here today to give you a thrilling display of escapement arts as we attempt, to extricate ourselves from this,..."
Phineas, ...the most complicated trap ever devised by man or child! A computer controlled tower so fiendishly clever that...
Phineas, ...its blueprints had to be viewed in a smoked mirror to avoid driving its creators insane!
Isabella," Wow, he's really selling it hard."
Baljeet," But if you designed the tower, will you not know every way to get out?"
Phineas," (taps tower with cane) We programmed it to learn as it goes, so it's conceivable we could be trapped in there forever. (taps tower with cane again) Coming with?"
Isabella," Yes! I mean, no./Baljeet: No!"
Isabella/Baljeet, No.
Buford, It sounds ill-advised.
Phineas, That's okay. You guys can stay out here and be the cheering section with Candace.
Candace, (snoring) Must bust Phineas and Ferb.
Baljeet, But what if you do not come out?
Phineas," If we're not out in 15 minutes, you can smash the machine and rescue us, just like in the old days."
Buford, (brings out mallet) Sounds like a party.
Phineas, Ferb? Start the timer please!
Buford, Synchronizing watches!
Phineas," (he and Ferb walks onto an elevator) Women and children and the faint of heart may wish (pushes button with cane) to leave now. (as the elevator rises up) So we bid you adieu! Goodbye! Auf wiedersehen! Farewell, friends!"
Phineas, And we'll see you in a few minutes! Or not at all!
Baljeet," Legally speaking, what is our liability here?"
Doofenshmirtz," A-ha! I wanted to say something clever about ""cat got your tongue"", but I haven't worked it out. You see, when we were small children, my brother Roger was always better at the whole manners and etiquette thing."
Young Roger," Sweet Aunt Effie, you have always been my favorite!"
Aunt Effie," (pinching young Roger's cheek) Roger, so polite. (hands young Roger a coin) Heinz?"
Young Doofenshmirtz, That's some mole!
Doofenshmirtz," (sighs) It takes a long time to clean out a chicken coop with a spoon. And I still don't see how that was rude. I mean, that thing was gargantuan. If anything, I was showing restraint. Anyway, today, it is International Good Manners Day, and we've got a visiting dignitary. She's the ambassador from England! Only the most etiquetty country in the whole world, hello! And when Roger's introducing her I'm going to zap him with my Rude-inator!"
Doofenshmirtz, That's what I'm calling it.
Doofenshmirtz," It makes whoever it zaps intolerably rude! He'll cause an international incident! And in all the confusion, I'll just waltz in and take over. So, why the catsuit? Well, we're going to be at City Hall to watch the fireworks, you and me, and I figured a platypus in a fedora might attract too much attention! Smart, huh? (walks away with a smug look) See, me, always thinking."
Phineas," Good day to you, Tower. We're ready to begin."
Tower," Welcome, boys. We're gonna have so much fun together. (puts strait-jackets on the boys) Put on your coats and stay a while."
Phineas, Strait-jackets. Classic. Ready?
Phineas," Okay, shake me out."
Phineas, Awesome!
Phineas, (after Ferb shakes his strait-jacket off) This is gonna be fun.
Phineas," I don't know, Ferb, I think we should ""file"" (pulls out a file) this under Dungeon Escape."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, here we are! (chuckles) Right up close! You sit here, Perry the Catypus. (laughs) I just came up with that. That totally makes up for missing the ""cat got your tongue"" thing from before."
Roger," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to City Hall on this fine first day of National Etiquette Week."
Woman, I do love proper etiquette!
Phineas," Hmm. Big keys, tiny doors. We're not fitting through any of those, but maybe that one!"
Phineas," Ferb, you're a genius!"
Tower," Nice warm up, boys."
Tower, But can you escape the relentless pull of gravity?
Phineas, (screaming) It's the Bottomless Pit Trap. (he and Ferb high fives)
Baljeet, It would be terrible if they did not come out!
Isabella, I know! (squirts some shaving cream on Candace's head)
Buford, I'm countin' on it.
Roger," And to speak further on this topic, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Ambassador from England, the most etiquetty country in the world..."
Doofenshmirtz, Told you!
Roger," ... and my personal friend,"
Roger, ...this unbelievable windbag right here.
Roger," Oh, man! On and on and on in the limo over here. (mimicking ambassador) ""Manners are so important."""
Doofenshmirtz," Can you believe this, Perry the..."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, for Pete's sake, Perry the Platypus. I told you to go before we left. (at himself) He better bring back some popcorn, that's all I can say."
Roger, ...what a pompous know-it-all you are.
Woman, That's it! I want a recall.
All, Recall! Recall! Recall!
Doofenshmirtz, (grinning) It's working!
Phineas, Wait! I've got it. Give me your hands.
Phineas," Come on, Tower!"
Phineas, Is that the best you can can throw at us?
Tower," (rudely) Ooh, so special. I don't give a flying buttress."
Phineas," Tower, are you feeling okay?"
Tower," Oh, what's it to you?"
Phineas," Oh, nothing, nothing."
Phineas, I thought we programmed you to be more polite than this.
Tower," You think you're so sharp, don't you?"
Tower, I'm gonna show you something sharper.
Phineas, I think there may be something wrong with the Tower. I'm taking suggestions here.
Phineas," Okay, dude, don't show off."
Baljeet," Oh, my gosh! It is almost time."
Isabella, (placing objects between Candace's toes) What if they can't get out?
Buford, (drawing an eye on the sticky note) How come you guys didn't tell me about this before?
Candace, Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
Phineas, Made it. Boy! That was close.
Baljeet, Was it scary?
Isabella, Was it hard?
Buford, Do I still get to smash the tower?
Tower, I ain't done with you yet. (activates a force field around its lower half)
Buford, Wow! I thought I had a bad attitude.
Audience, Recall! Recall!
Roger, ...and so's your sister!
Doofenshmirtz, Wow! Such rudeness. This is working better than I ever imagined.
Roger," Miss High-and-Mighty English Manners Person, I have got one thing to say to you. And only one thing. That's some..."
Roger," ...show we just put on, isn't it, Madam Mayor?"
Doofenshmirtz, What the...
Ambassador," You see, your wonderful Mayor and I agreed in the limousine to put on this little play for your edification."
Doofenshmirtz," (pushing button on remote repeatedly) No, no, no, no."
Ambassador," Indeed, what would we be without manners?"
Audience, Four more years. Four more years.
Doofenshmirtz," (pause) Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I didn't even get my popcorn. (realizes) Wait. If they were faking it, what did my ray hit?"
Tower," Ooh, it looks like you two losers are still trapped. Might as well change your address, 'cause you're gonna be receiving your pension in here. Oopsie, activated my vacuum circuits. You dummies don't need air, do you? (blows raspberry)"
Phineas, I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror.
Buford," Don't worry, I'll get you out in just a sec."
Buford, You guys are on your own.
Phineas," Well, thanks for trying I guess."
Buford, No problem. What are friends for?
Tower, Friends? I have been programmed to trap you and your friends.
Phineas," Oh, yeah!"
Baljeet," Do me a favor. Next time you wanna make a fiendishly clever computer-controlled contraption, call one of your other friends."
Phineas, Hey! That's it. (at the tower) Tower. You were programmed to trap Ferb and me and our friends. But we've got friends all over Danville.
Tower, Is that so?
Phineas," In fact, we have friends all over the Tri-State Area."
Tower," Well, aren't we popular?"
Ferb, Plus there was that small matter of circumnavigating the globe.
Phineas," You're right. Tokyo, Paris, Nepal. We have friends all over the Earth."
Tower," Look at me, I have got friends all over the Earth. All right then."
Phineas," In fact, we even have an alien friend named Meap."
Phineas," He is from another planet. So, really, we have friends all over the galaxy."
Tower, A small matter for one such as me.
Tower, You will never escape. Never!
Baljeet, That works for me.
Buford," Well, they only make mallets so big."
Isabella, See ya.
Phineas," So, the entire galaxy. (grins) That enough elbow room for ya?"
Ferb," Well, for today."
Alien," At last, after two millennia, we finally reached the Milky Way Galaxy. Battle stations! We begin our assault in three, two... Oh!"
Alien," Uh, anybody got a mallet?"
