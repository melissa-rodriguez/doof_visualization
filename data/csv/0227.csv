Phineas," I don't know about you, Ferb, but I think bubbles have a great sense of humor. Look at what that bubble's doing to my face. (laughs) You make me laugh out loud, bubble."
Baljeet, Hello!
Phineas," Hey, Baljeet."
Baljeet, What are you guys doing?
Phineas, We're blowing bubbles and relaxing.
Baljeet," Oh, I remember being relaxed, but that was before I had this! (shows Phineas and Ferb a schedule)"
Phineas, That looks like a color coded schedule.
Baljeet," That's because it is. Every minute of my entire day is planned out right here. Remember how you told me to seize the day? Well, consider it seized!"
Phineas, That's not exactly what I meant.
Buford," Hey, is it time for me yet?"
Baljeet," Not quite. (brief pause) Okay, now. (Buford licks his finger and sticks it in Baljeet's ear)"
Phineas, Do you have any extra time for a bubble?
Baljeet," Uh, I guess I have time for one."
Buford," Oh, oh! Can I blow a huge one so I can crawl inside it and float around like a little woodland pixie? (stops, realizing his mistake) Did I just say that out loud?"
Phineas," Yes, yes you did. But that actually sounds fun minus the pixie part. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! There's no better way to see Danville than from inside a huge bubble."
Buford, I wanna float around! (again realizing his mistake) Like men.
Phineas," Wanna come, Baljeet?"
Baljeet, My schedule is extremely tight. I doubt I even have a second to answer your question. Maybe if I move my polka recital back. Okay.
Phineas, Great! So you're coming?
Baljeet," No! I moved polka back so I could answer your question! It would take some major rearranging, but I think I can at least come and watch you make the bubble."
Phineas," Awesome! Hey, where's Perry?"
Baljeet, Haha! Right on time! I had Perry's absence on my schedule!
Major Monogram," Shh! Quiet, Carl! He's coming!"
Major Monogram/Carl, Surprise!
Carl, Alright!
Major Monogram," Happy Birthday, Agent P! (blows into kazoo) (awkward pause) It's not your birthday, is it? (Perry shakes his head) Are we close?"
Carl, Told ya!
Major Monogram," Put a sock in it, Carl! (clears throat) I, uh, was a bit too busy planning your party, so I'm not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up too, but I am sure that it's no good. Get to the bottom of it!"
Linda," So, Candace, are you ready to do some practice driving for your permit?"
Candace, I'm easing my way into the driver's seat. I start with what's familiar and slide into the new.
Linda, Well start sliding. We've got errands to run.
Candace," Okay, you drive!"
Linda, Your dad says you're already good at parallel parking.
Candace, That was in the backyard! That's way different than the open road!
Linda," Candace, I thought you wanted to be the first of your friends to have a driver's license."
Candace," Okay, I'm sliding."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here. I did get your invite to your birthday party over the internet, and naturally, I couldn't go, since it was most likely a trap. Anyway, I got you this. (hands Perry a birthday card) It's just a card, but here you go. (card traps Perry) Surprise! Haha! I finally figured out why my evil schemes always fail. You see, I am totally, completely, unlikeable. No, really, so I asked myself, ""what are the two most liked things on the planet?"" The answer? Country music and western music. So now, I'm bringing them together for the first time. I'm calling it ""Country and Western Music."" I know, I know. I'm brilliant, right?"
Phineas," Great bubble design, Ferb. Now all we need is the missing bubble ingredient."
Isabella, Hey guys. Whatcha doin'?
Baljeet, Making changes to my schedule.
Phineas," We're building a machine to make the biggest, most durable bubble ever."
Baljeet," Oh, right. Nobody ever asks what Baljeet is doing."
Phineas," We have just about everything we need for our durable bubble, but if you guys wanna help out, we still need some sap from a maracanut tree."
Isabella," Yeah, we can definitely do that."
Phineas," Excellent! While they're doing that, we can finish the design on the transponder. See you girls back at the field!"
Doofenshmirtz," I know what you're thinking, ""But Doof, you have a terrible singing voice! Well, feast your eyes on this little baby! (unveils a cowboy hat) Ta-daâ€”I call it the Yodelinator! Pretty cool, eh? Oh, right. You just think it's a big cowboy hat. It's so much more! (presses a button on the hat) See? Huh? See? It's designed to make my singing voice sweet and mellifluous. So, my first gig is in an hour. Come on, you can help me hand out fliers. Everyone's going to (singsong) love me!"
Linda," You can do this, Candace! Just look into the turn and ease your foot off the brake."
Candace," I'm l-l-l-l-looking into the turn....(gasps as she sees Phineas, Ferb, and the rest of the kids with the bubble machine in the park) (just as a bus with two monsters on the side pulls up, blocking the view) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb!"
Linda," Candace, I don't find that funny."
Linda," Oh good. Now we're-- Candace, slow down!"
Phineas," Nice work as usual, Ferb! All we need now is the final ingredient."
Isabella," Hey, Phineas! We got the sap you guys needed. Here! (hands him a vial)"
Phineas," Thanks! (pours sap into bubble machine. Ferb pushes a button and turns a valve. The machine begins blowing the giant bubble, which slowly encases the gang as Phineas speaks) At this stage, the maracanut sap isn't fully congealed. So we can pass through the semi-permeable membrane with ease. (bubble walls give way and he is inside the bubble) Voila!"
Isabella," Girls, I think we just earned our Passing-Through-A-Semi-Permeable-Membrane patches! (Fireside Girls cheer)"
Candace," See, there they...... (they see only the machine)"
Linda," Perhaps I should get tired of asking this, but....what am I supposed to be looking at?"
Candace," Ugh! They were right there in the...(sees the bubble floating behind a building) Hold onto something, Mom. (floors the accelerator)"
Baljeet," Well, that was very entertaining, but that is all the time I have scheduled for. (notices how high they are) Oh, wait. You are already airborne. And I am already still with you. (begins to panic a little) I do not believe this! My schedule is totally blown! I am going to miss my polka recital!"
Buford, I've heard you. It's a small loss.
Linda," Candace, trash cans again!"
Candace," Oops, heh heh. My bad. Where'd they go? (sticks her head out the window to see them floating away)"
Linda," Candace, I think we've all had enough of your driving!"
Candace," Not now, Mom! I have to get this car into the sky! (drives at full speed again)"
Linda, (screaming) Candaaaace!
Baljeet," Oh, no! How long are we going to be up here?"
Phineas, (reclining) Awhile.
Baljeet, And...and how do you even STEER this thing?
Phineas, We're at the mercy of the breeze.
Baljeet," (laughs nervously) Sure, when you say it like that, it sounds relaxing."
Phineas, Hey everybody! Downdraft! (They float down and pass under a bridge)
Baljeet," Oh no, look out! Power lines!"
Isabella," Girls, you know what to do!"
Isabella and the Fireside Girls," Leeeeaaaannnn! (they all slam against the side of the bubble and it swerves, avoiding the power lines. Everyone cheers)"
Baljeet, Cactus garden!
Isabella," Lean! (this time, everyone slams against the side and the bubble swerves into an alleyway)"
Baljeet, PUBLIC ART!
Gretchen," With our angle of descent, leaning will be ineffectual!"
Everybody else, What?
Gretchen, We're gonna craaash!
Baljeet, Oh no! I knew I should not have forsaken the rigid beauty of my candy-colored schedule!
Phineas, The bubble is expanding. It's Baljeet's breathing! (Baljeet keeps going) It's blowing the bubble up! Everybody breathe heavy like Baljeet!
Fireside Girls and Isabella, Yes sir!
Phineas," We're doing it! (Everyone cheers) Baljeet, you totally saved us!"
Baljeet," When in danger, I always hyperventilate."
Cowboy singer," Thank you, everyone! Thank you very much!"
Doofenshmirtz," I'm next, Perry the Platypus. After this concert, I will be the most well liked man in the Tri-State Area!"
Person 1, I like that guy!
Person 2, Yeah! Let's do whatever he says!
Person 2, He's terrible!
Person 3, Yeah! It stinks so bad I wanna break somethin'!
Person 3, That really wasn't worth it.
Person 2, You can't mix country and western! They's two completely different types of music!
Person 4, That song was horrible!
Person 5," Yeah, those lyrics was way too on the nose!"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, that wasn't as successful as I'd hoped.... (grabs jet-pack and puts it on) but at least I can beat a hasty retreat before I'm too humiliated!"
Doofenshmirtz," Huh? (laughs nervously) For your information, I had these way before I met you. (jet-pack shoots by and he walks away) (Halfheartedly) Okay, see you tomorrow."
Linda," Candace, watch where you're going!"
Candace, They're around here somewhere. (she sees the bubble) Ooh! Ooh! (laughs crazily) There they are! Headed for the old drawbridge! You're mine!
Linda," Candace, stop!"
Candace," I can't! (the drawbridge opens and they rocket into the sky. Linda screams and covers her eyes. The bubble floats in front of them) There they are! I told you! I--Mom, open your eyes!"
Linda, (terrified) Not until we're back on the ground!
Candace, (they shoot past the bubble) Mooooom!
Phineas, That was Candace driving.
Ferb, Her car control has gotten a lot better.
Candace," Mom, we're back on the ground! Ahhhhhhh! (eye twitches)"
Linda," Okay Candace, now just gently...apply...the brake."
Candace, I'm tryiiiiing!
Baljeet," Wow. This whole relaxation thing is...well, relaxing."
Linda," Candace, at least take your foot off the gas."
Candace," (enraged) Oh, you think? You think?! (lifts her foot) There! How's that?! Is that better!?!"
Linda," Well, guess your father was right. You do have parallel parking down."
Candace, Look! There they are!
Linda," Candace, I can't see anything. ""They"" who?"
Candace," The boys! They're up in there in the -- (the bubble pops, releasing the kids onto the rides) Ugh."
Linda," Oh, hi boys!"
Phineas," (riding a bouncy animal) Hi, Mom! Nice parking, Candace."
Candace," What?! No! It's not -- but they were up -- (leans on the car wheel, setting off the horn)"
Phineas," Well, Ferb, I guess we should consider this day: Seized. (sees Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry."
