Candace, It's totally time for a totally favorite TV show!
Candace," (offering Jeremy a seat) Hey there, Jeremy. Care to have a seat? I have something to show you."
Candace, (mysterious voice) It's impossibly important...
Candace," Ohh, it's starting! (put finger to Jeremy's lips) Shhhh..."
Candace,Let's All Dance Until We're Sick (song)
Nikki," Hi ya! Nikki Stars here. Get ready Danville, because the most popular dance contest is coming to you!"
Candace," See Jeremy, that's my surprise. They're taping Danville and I already entered us!"
Stacy," No, great! You guys are totally gonna win!"
Jeremy," Sure, Candace! Um.. I'm gonna go get some fresh air, okay?"
Candace, Okay!
Candace, (talking to Stacy) He's so excited to get free!
Phineas," So, brother of mine, what ever shall we engage into today? (changes subject of the conversation) Hey Jeremy! What's the hapt of it, guy?"
Jeremy," Oh, man. Your sister's into that some big dance show. And, you know, I just don't wanna let her down."
Phineas," So, what's the problem?"
Jeremy, Have you seen the fancy dancing on the show? I can fake it in a school auditorium. Just not in a nationally syndicated dance show.
Phineas," Well, maybe Ferb can teach you."
Jeremy, Wow. That's really-
Phineas, (interrupting) Uhp-uhp! Wait for it...
Jeremy, There's no way I can't learn that by tonight.
Phineas," Hmmm...maybe you don't have to. (to Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Phineas, What?
Phineas, Oh. Sorry. (grabs Ferb's hand and pulls him up) Hey! I wonder where Perry is!
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P. Seems Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying the entire Tri-State Area's supply: potatoes, vegan, and whole boatloads of chopped green onions-sounds like a recipe for evil, literally. So, get cooking Agent P! Monogram out."
Phineas," So, here it is! The Ferbalistic Groovatron 9000!"
Jeremy, How is that supposed to help me?
Phineas," You put it under your clothes, and nobody will see this electronic exoskeleton helping you with dance moves!"
Phineas," Ferb does the fancy dancing move over here, and you do the same fancy dancing move over there!"
Jeremy, Sweet.
Computer voice, Intruder alert.
Doofenshmirtz," Well, well, well, look who's here. Perry the Platypus. All shackled up and no place to go! Um, I think we made too much potato salad, Norm. I guess we'll have to give everyone a 2-ton take-home container. And I still think you should have added more green onions."
Norm," Well, next time you'll do all the cooking and I'll stand around coming up with evil plans that ultimately fail!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wow. Cuttin' deep, man. Well, I'm off to my annual evil potluck and press conference. I'll just leave you here to, you know, to meet your doom. This, was on the movie. I didn't catch the ending, and other things to do, but it seems really bulletproof. Well, gotta run and y'can't be at two places at one time, so you'll be able to... (turning to Norm) Norm, let's go."
Norm, Wouldn't it kill you to say please once in a while?
Doofenshmirtz, You're going to be like this all day.
Norm," Yes. Yes, I am."
Candace," We are so going to win, this time, Jeremy. We are going TO WIN!"
Nikki," Dancers, your dance floor awaits!"
Nikki," Our dancers will boogie until they get axed for the judges. If your light goes out, your time is up. Now, let the dancing begin!"
Phineas, Ready?
Dr. Bloodpudding," Alright Heinz, where's the press?"
Doofenshmirtz," Patience, Dr. Bloodpudding, they'll be here. When have I ever let you guys down?"
Rodney," Far too often Doofenshmirtz, far too often."
Doofenshmirtz," Rodney, I don't remember inviting you."
Rodney, I told you! I prefer you use my full name: Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth Otto Wolfgang Hypatia Gunther Galen Gary Cooper von Roddenstein!
Doofenshmirtz," Anyway, today is the day we reveal to the Tri-State Area, the existence of the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness!"
Dr. Bloodpudding, You want us to be called L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.?
Doofenshmirtz, Oh good grief!! It doesn't matter what we're called. What's important is that we get our evil message out to the people of the Tri-State Area!
Rodney, And how are we going to that with no TV cameras or no press of any kind?
Doofenshmirtz," They'll be here, they'll be here. Clearly, they buffet along and bring us."
Norm," Yummy, yummy potato salad!"
Rodney, And we do seem to have a surplus of that. (Grins mockingly) Did you expect everyone to lug home 2-ton take home bags?
Doofenshmirtz, No.
Norm, (suddenly) Yes.
Doofenshmirtz," Shut it, Norm. Whose side are you on, anyway? And the press will be here, Rodney."
Dr. Diminutive," I don't think so, Heinz!"
Doofenshmirtz, Dr. Diminutive?
Dr. Diminutive," Here, look. All the present town is covering this."
News broadcaster, That's right. Let's Dance 'Til We're Sick is filming here in Danville. And I've got all the live coverage 24/7!
Doofenshmirtz," Well, if the press won't come to us, we'll go to the press. To the dance hall!"
Doofenshmirtz," Attention, miserable citizens of Danville!"
Doofenshmirtz, Hello? Evil scientist speaking! Can you get a hand over here? What? Nothing? Why are they so focused on those dancers?
Rodney," Because it's a dance contest, Heinz. Clear, they're only filming the best dancers!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hm. Wait! That's it! Okay. Split up and dance like you've never danced before! Whoever gets on camera first, they deliver our message of evil!"
Rodney," Man, they're terrible!"
Doofenshmirtz, Ahh! The humanity!!
Rodney, This looks like a job for Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth-
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, can it, Rodney. I think we both know that I'm a better evil dancer than you."
Rodney, (Holds up his hand in Doofenshmirtz' face) See this? It's my hand. You can talk to it.
Doofenshmirtz, All right. Hey hand! My evil dancing's better than yours. It's like you're stuck in a canoe but you've got no oars. See you on the dance floor!
Rodney, Nobody talks to my hand that way!
Major Monogram," (via Perry's wristwatch communicator) Agent P, you must stop Doofenshmirtz and his unnamed gang of evil scientists before they broadcast their message of evil, and interrupt what is going to be my and Carl's favorite show."
Nikki," Well, this shindig is in full swing! Looks like judges are starting to eliminate dancers, who will survive?"
Candace, They're eliminating people. Let's kick it up a notch!
Doofenshmirtz," People of the Tri-State Area, you may begin pointing in fear about the endless possibilities in miserable convenience of-"
Doofenshmirtz, Really? Were you even watching that move?
Rodney," (while doing his ballet) Well, my future subjects of desiring Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth-"
Rodney, This is ful zwein...
Doofenshmirtz, So I represent the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments-
Doofenshmirtz, Ah! Philistine! It was a perfectly good Charleston!
Candace, Oh! You are r-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-a--l-l-l-l-l-y-
Stacy," Bravo! Bravo! (tosses a bouquet of flowers) Go, Candace!"
Random guy," Oh, that guy is awesome!"
Nikki, Looks like someone's a fan favorite.
Doofenshmirtz," This is my spotlight! Who's pushing this dancer out of the way, it's me!"
Rodney," Oh no, Doofenshmirtz, I was here first!"
Doofenshmirtz, (Goes face-to-face directly with Rodney) Am I gonna have to talk to your hand again?!?!
Rodney, Maybe in your own dumb mind!
Nikki, And look! There's only one dancer left standing! Let's see what he does.
Nikki," (while the audience applaud for Jeremy) Say, that was fabulicious dancing out there! I see quite a future for someone with moves like that!"
Candace, Is she saying what a thing she's saying?
Nikki, How'd you like to dance 'til you're sick every week?
Candace," Do it, Jeremy, do it! We could be stars! Dancing stars! We can-"
Jeremy," I can't do this. All those great dance moves I've been doing today, it was actually..."
Stacy, That's kind of disturbing.
Jeremy," It was this crazy contraption doing all these dance moves. If you wanna see what a real dancer looks like, then here you go!"
Ferb," Well, looks like my work here is done."
Jeremy," But I'm sorry about all this, Candace. I just didn't want to let you down."
Candace," Oh, Jeremy. You weren't gonna let me down. I just wanted you to come out with me and have a good time! And you know, dance 'til we're sick!"
Jeremy," Well, I am feeling a little dizzy."
Candace," I got 'ya, big guy. (They leave the studio)"
Doofenshmirtz," (in the intensive care system) They should have called it ""Let's All Dance Until We're In Intensive Care""."
