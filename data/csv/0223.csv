Phineas, Is it here yet?
Mail Lady," Sorry, boys. Not today."
Phineas," Aw, rats."
Mail Lady," Oh, wait, boys. I almost forgot, your mom's Penny Shopper."
Candace, Hey! When you two gonna move that stupid box out of the doorway?
Phineas, Box? When did that come?
Candace, The delivery guy brought it while you two were camping out in the mailbox.
Phineas," Oh, man. I can't believe it's here! Finally, the world-famous x-ray vision glasses. This is gonna be great! Whoa! We got totally ripped-off! Ferb, let me see that comic again. Oh, for crying out loud! ""Amazing illusion""? ""Fool your friends""? ""Does not actually provide x-ray vision"". Oh, man, this is a rip-off! It's just like the body building course we got last summer."
Phineas, And I was so looking forward to looking through things.
Phineas," Ferb, that's it! I know what we're gonna today!"
Candace," Oh, my gosh! Are you the cutest thing ever? Aw, you're so adorable! I just could eat you up. Not literally, but you know what I mean."
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Agent P, Doofenshmirtz is up to his usual shenanigans, but we have a more serious problem. There's a rouge agent on the loose, and he's in your area. Carl's working with our field agents...to create a composite sketch."
Carl," Finished, sir!"
Major Monogram," Carl? You said you could draw! (to Perry) I'm sorry, Agent P. In the meanwhile, he may try to find one of your secret passages and infiltrate your lair where he could hack into our mainframe. So, be on the lookout for any suspicious characters."
Phineas," Look, Ferb, there's Perry."
Phineas," Maybe that's where he disappears to all the time. Well, if he got himself up there, he can get himself down. Anyway, we've got the frames and the polycarbonate lens solution. Now what we need is something that really improves eyesight. (Snaps his fingers) Hey, I know!"
Phineas," Oh, Ferb, you're way ahead of me."
Major Monogram," Agent P, we've hired a professional artist and got much better results. We've identified the rogue agent as Dennis. He's a mercenary for hire and master of disguise. You need to stop him at all costs."
Candace," First, I'm going to name you Mr. Cutie-Patootie. Then we'll give you a complete makeover, and teach you some cool tricks. You stay put while I find you a new stylish outfit. Let's see what we got here. (While Dennis, now standing upright, searches for an entrance to Perry's lair) What am I doing with a scepter? Huh. Next! Leopard headbands are so last year. Ooh, here's some of my doll clothes! Eh, let's skip the tiara. What is this? Leg warmers? Who wears leg warmers? I definitely don't."
Candace, Mr. Cutie-Patootie?
Candace," I finally found— (Notices Perry, then nudges him out from her room with a foot) Get away from him! I don't want your blandness to rub off. (Picks up Dennis, then slams the door) Aw, poor Mr. Cutie-Patootie. Don't mind him. Once I'm done making you over, you're going to be new alpha pet."
Dennis, (Coughs)
Candace, (Gasps) I know! Matching shoes!
Candace, I found it! These shoes should complete the outfit.
Template,"Spacer Template:Picture (Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz Evil, Incorporated)"
Doofenshmirtz," ""Ah, Perry the Platypus! How unexpected for you to burst in my nefarious..."" (Looks at a script) Nefarious? No, it's not. It's too much, even for me."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus is due any second. (checking the time on his watch) Hey, it's getting a little late. Where is he?"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, who needs him? He never does anything until after I tell him my plans. He just stands there like a potted plant. (pauses, then notices a potted plant) In fact... (places a folded newspaper hat on the plant) Ah, Planty the Potted Plant. How unexpected! (pushes a button) I'd invite you to foil my latest scheme, (A rope comes down from a vent) but I can see you're all tied up. (Planty gets captured) You see, I don't even need Perry the Platypus."
Phineas," Mom's just got back from the grocery store, so we ought to have plenty of carrots for our x-ray glasses."
Candace, Thank you very much!
Phineas," Oh, actually, Candace, we need those."
Candace," Oh, really? For your stupid x-ray glasses?"
Phineas," (angry, shows hand) Hey! They're not stu --"
Candace, Do you know what this is?
Phineas," Uh, is it not a rabbit?"
Candace, This is an actual living creature that uses carrots for food instead of science experiments.
Ferb," So, why is he wearing a tutu?"
Candace," He likes it! Don't worry, Mr. Cutie-Patootie. They're just jealous."
Phineas,"Come on, maybe Isabella has some carrots. (Scene switches to the living room...)"
Candace," Okay, let's start with some simple tricks. Sit."
Candace," Roll over! (Pause) Do the Worm! (Pause) Now the Robot. (Pause) Great! Wow, you must really like carrots. (Runs out of the living room)"
Linda," What the? (Looks over to see Perry and Dennis in pet mode) Oh, a bunny rabbit. Candace must have gotten a new pet."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, Planty the Potted Plant, since you're just hanging around.... (chuckles) Let me demonstrate the brilliant evil-losity of my latest inven..."
Doofenshmirtz," Grr. You see? See, that's what I'm talking about. Ever since those condos next door started allowing pets, it's been driving me bonkers! All day and all night with the barking, barking, barking! (pulls the lever) Oh, that is why I created my latest masterpiece of evil... giant Dog-Biscuit-inator."
Doofenshmirtz," Thank you! Thank you for my point for me! (to Planty) Now, I'll cover it with an irresistible gravy coating, and then it will take off and soar through town, getting all the dogs to chase after it until they follow it right off the edge of the Tri-State area! (smiles smugly) Well, Planty the Potted Plant. Pretty clever, eh? (pauses, then pushes Planty away) Don't give me that look. Prepare to launch..."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, how did you do that? (Gets hit on back of his head again) Ow! Ow! Come out in the open where I can... Ow!"
Phineas," Stomp harder, Ferb! This carrot juice is gotta be really concentrated."
Isabella," Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
Phineas, Just waiting for the concentrated carrot extract to mix with the super heated optical polymers. Now I dip the frames to the x-ray solution. It may take a couple of hours to set properly.
Isabella, Or just five minutes in my Quick-E-Bake Oven. Fireside Girls are always prepared. (Places x-ray glasses in the Quick-E-Bake Oven)
Isabella, (Taps the x-ray glasses) Looks like they're ready. (Hands them to Phineas)
Phineas, Here goes nothing.
Isabella," Hey, it sounds like it's coming from my house."
Isabella," Mom, what's wrong?"
Vivian, I lost my wedding ring!
Isabella," Okay, Mom, when did you have been doing since you last saw it?"
Vivian," Ah, si, si, si. I was fixing some lunch, then I washed the dishes."
Phineas," (Raises an eyebrow) Dishes, huh? It looks like a job for x-ray vision glasses. (Blinks, then finds Vivian's wedding ring stuck in the drainpipe) I found it!"
Vivian," Ah, thank you, Phineas. Uh...where is it?"
Phineas," Down in the drainpipe under the sink. (Moves left curtain) We'll have it out for you in a jiff. (to Ferb) Quick, Ferb! We need a 14-inch pipe wrench, a blowtorch, and a jar of mayonnaise."
Vivian," Ooh, that's very sweet of you boys, but I think I'll call my regular plumber. He's bonded."
Phineas," (Takes off x-ray glasses) Okay, suit yourself."
Isabella, The glasses work great!
Phineas, (Puts the glasses back on) This is gonna be fun.
Phineas, Looks our x-ray vision glasses have passed all the quality control tests.
Isabella," Good thing, because we're stocking up quite a pile of orders."
Phineas, Excellent. It's time to order a big truck load of carrots.
Candace, Mr. Cutie-Patootie?! Where are you?! MR. CUTIE PATOOTIE!!!
Female Voice, Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
Major Monogram," Uh, hello, Agent... (Gasps) No! Not you! Agent P, you've got to stop him before he..."
Female Voice, Access granted.
Phineas," (While talking on the phone) Yes, ma'am, you heard me right. I need three metric tons of your highest grade carrots delivered A.S.A.P. (Person on the other end answers) Why yes, yes I am."
Candace, Have you seen Mr. Cutie-Patootie? I can't find him anywhere.
Phineas," Well, did you check the backyard? He might be there."
Phineas, Hmm. How about the kitchen?
Doofenshmirtz," (Sighs wearily) Well, Planty the Potted Plant. You have proven yourself quite the adversary. Why don't we just...call this one a draw? (Plops himself against the door) I'm kind of pooped."
Doofenshmirtz," Ah! Curse you, Planty the Potted Plant!"
Major Monogram," Good work, Agent P. (Gives a thumbs up)"
Candace, You don't suppose he could've run away?
Phineas," Don't worry. I'm sure he'll turn up. (Notices that all the carrots have disappeared) Hey, what happened to all the carrots? One minute there's a backyard full of carrots. I turn around for half a minute and; Poof! – now they're gone!"
Candace, Welcome to my world.
Phineas," Wow, that must be really annoying."
Candace," (Notices Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. (Perry tiredly lies on the stone walk; she then pets him) At least you're still around. Do you like wearing pink?"
Major Monogram," On behalf of the entire Agency, I like to thank you for your valiant service in one of our darkest hours. (places a medal and a fedora on Planty) Planty the Potted Plant, welcome to the Agency."
