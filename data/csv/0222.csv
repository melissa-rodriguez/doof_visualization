Vanessa," Dad, I need a car. I can't keep riding on the back of your scooter every time I go someplace. It's totally embarrassing."
Biker," Hey, sweetheart. How'd you like to take a ride on a real bike?"
Doofenshmirtz, She's sixteen!
Baby alien," (giggles) Oh, yeah!"
Doofenshmirtz," You know, ever since I installed the Away-inator on my helmet, driving is fun again!"
Phineas," Hey, Ferb, check this out. (looking at a map) The Super-Duper Megastore is the largest supplier of everything in the Tri-State Area. Heh. I know what we're gonna do today!"
Candace," Well, I'm gonna buy Jeremy a gift. It's the anniversary of the very first time Jeremy and I went to Slushy Burger. He spilled a cheese dog on me and mustard got all over the place. He was so sweet."
Stacy, Hmm. Tough one. I don't think they make a card for that.
Phineas," So Mom, what are you gonna get at the store?"
Linda, I need a 25 pound tub of mayonnaise and 80 pounds of potatoes to make potato salad for the bridge club.
Phineas, (Puts away his map) Wow. That's a lot of potato salad.
Linda, (Parks the car) Remember to meet me back at the car in three hours. (Everyone leaves the car)
Phineas," Wow, think of it, Ferb. Fifty-two million, six-hundred thirty-seven thousand square acres of unbridled consumerism all under one roof."
Ferb, (Wolf whistles)
Phineas, You can whistle that again.
Ferb, (Wolf whistles)
Linda," (While walking him to the Park Your Pooch department on a leash) And you get to go to the pet-sitter's, Perry."
Doofenshmirtz," (takes off his helmet) If you want a car, (Vanessa takes off her helmet) you're going to have to prove to me that you're responsible, that you can do things by yourself."
Vanessa, How could I do that when I'm always on the back of your scooter?
Doofenshmirtz," (Walks into the superstore) It's a conundrum, isn't it?"
Major Monogram," (talking from a screen set into the bone) Psst. Agent P. Agent P. (Perry puts on his fedora) Down here. (Camera zooms into the bone) It's the new dog bone communicator. Pretty clever, huh?"
Carl," I thought of it, Agent P."
Major Monogram," Carl, I'm trying to use the bone. (to Perry) Anyway, Agent P, we've learned that Dr. Doofenshmirtz is shopping for parts to build another one of his outlandish devices. Put a tail on him."
Man, You look fabulous!
Vanessa, So I've got to find some way to prove to you I'm responsible. There must be an easier way to earn a car.
Doofenshmirtz, You know what they say about taking the easy way.
Vanessa, What do they say?
Doofenshmirtz," Well, I could tell you, but that would be taking the easy way, and you know what they say about that. Ooh, look! Pizzazium Infinionite!"
Vanessa, What's that?
Film Speaker," You've heard of hydrogen. You may know boron. But of all the elements on the periodic table, none is more fascinating and less abundant than Pizzazium Infinionite. Pizzazium Infinionite was first discovered by fortune hunters fifty years ago in the year 1894. No one is really sure what it does, but look to the future for hover vehicles powered by Pizzazium Infinionite, in the world of tomorrow!"
Doofenshmirtz, See? That's what it is.
Vanessa, Where did you get the...
Doofenshmirtz, It's gone! Someone took the last one!
Baljeet, What luck! Pizzazzium Infinionite! That science prize is as good as mine!
Buford, So why am I here again?
Baljeet," Because, (hands it to Buford to hold) as a person of superior intellect, I require an angry wall of meat to protect my science project."
Buford," Angry wall of meat, huh? Yeah, I can do that."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great. Now I have to scour this whole place and find the Pizzazzium and probably have to wrench it out of the hands of some random shopper."
Vanessa," Wait, Dad. I can do this for you. I can go find this--this Pizzazzium thing and prove to you that I can be responsible. That I can do things on my own. Then you can get me my own car, right?"
Doofenshmirtz, I don't know. Are you sure you can...
Vanessa, Of course I can. I'm me. It'll be a piece of cake.
Doofenshmirtz, We'll see.
Vanessa, (sing-song) I'm not hearing a no.
Doofenshmirtz," (sing-song) I'm not saying a yes. (pause) Here, you can take this Pizzazzium locator. It'll help."
Candace, How am I gonna find that one perfect gift in this humongous store?
Stacy," Hey, isn't Jeremy into camping?"
Candace, Yeah.
Stacy," So maybe a pocket knife, or a fishing lure,...or a compound bow. (imitates someone shooting an arrow) Take that, apple on kid's head!"
Candace, (gasps) He said he needed a lantern!
Stacy," Yeah, a lantern's good."
Baljeet, And then I will start my own foundation to... Are you not hearing me?
Buford, What? Buford hungry. (accidentally drops tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite over balcony)
Baljeet, I really have to rethink having you as my wall of meat.
Candace, Too big.
Stacy, Too small.
Candace," Oh, I don't want to get him just any old lantern."
Stacy, You can't expect the perfect gift to just drop out of the sky.
Candace, But... (holds hands out in expression and the tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite lands in them)
Stacy, Woah.
Candace, It's perfect! It's all futuristic-y and cool...and it dropped out of the sky!
Stacy," Well, I guess I stand corrected."
Candace," When Jeremy looks into its bright glow, he'll think of me...(Candace and Stacy notice the switch) Hey, what's this?"
Both, Ahh!
Doofenshmirtz," Hey buddy, watch where you're... Say, you look fabulous. (a brief clip of ""Fabulous"" plays) Haven't I seen you somewhere before? (Perry chatters then flees the scene) No need to get huffy, you ran into me!"
Phineas," Ahhh. You know Ferb, I think I know what I want to do every day."
Vanessa," (beeping gets more rapid, and she notices the tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite on the ground) Well, that was easy."
Baljeet," ...I gotta get it, gotta g... gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it..."
Baljeet," Yes! Mine, mine mine mine mine mine mine!"
Vanessa," Wha- hey! Watch where you're... Oh great, now this thing is broken, and they've got the Pizzazziu... (sighs) Look, (to Ferb) thanks for your help, but I can do this on my own, okay? (runs away with Pizzazzium locator)"
Candace, (sighs) That lantern was the perfect gift.
Baljeet, Woo-hoo!
Candace, Buford and Baljeet! How did they get it?
Vanessa," ♪ I can do it, I can run, I can hunt you down ♪"
Phineas," Ferb, you've gotta try this chair! I can't feel my brain!"
Vanessa," (searching through the ball pit) Ugh, I hope nobody sees me in here."
Linda," Ferb, honey, aren't you a little old to be playing in the ball pit?"
Ferb," Yes, yes I am."
Linda, Okay then. (walks away; Vanessa emerges from under the balls)
Vanessa, Your name is Ferb?
Ferb," Well yes, it's short for... (the vacuum pulls up the Pizzazium) Oh, here it is."
Vanessa," (grabs Pizzazium and runs out of the pit) Thanks, Ferb! See you around!"
Doofenshmirtz," (walking up to a lawn mower with a sign above it) Push button, start mower. Does this really work?"
Baljeet, I will take that!
Phineas," Ferb, my fingers look just like snakes!"
Doofenshmirtz," (at a ""Mystic Eye"" table) Oh, it's one of those 3D things. (holds up the picture) I can hardly see the... (Perry crashes through the picture, dropping the Pizzazium) Oop, there it is."
Vanessa, Ferb!
Stacy, Check it out! They do make a card for a spilled cheese dog with mustard.
Vanessa," Well, Ferb. You certainly know how to show a girl a good time! (holds up the Pizzazium) I've gotta get this to my dad immediately. (Ferb throws the Pizzazium into the tennis ball launcher, which fires) Whoa! (the Pizzazium bounces and rolls past Doofenshmirtz, in line at the checkout counter, to the entrance of the store; Doofenshmirtz gleefully picks it up) Well, that worked."
Doofenshmirtz," I got it! I got it! (Perry moves the alarm sensor at the entrance, causing the security alarm to go off) I got it! (two security guards show up)"
Security guard," Excuse me sir, you know you have to pay for this. (takes the Pizzazium)"
Doofenshmirtz, I was! I was going to pay!
Security guard, Tell it to the judge.
Doofenshmirtz," Don't worry, guys, we'll- we'll get this all straightened out. Va- Vanessa! Vanessa... (the guards drag him away) No no, you can't take me, I don't have anyone to curse!"
