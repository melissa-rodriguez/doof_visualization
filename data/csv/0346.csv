Linda," Candace, honey, I'm going out to a birthday party."
Candace, For who?
Linda, You know Vivian's aunt's sister's landlord's son?
Candace, Evan?
Linda, His son.
Candace, Dexter?
Linda, Yeah. It's his birthday.
Candace, Why do they even have parties for two-year-olds? It's not like they're going to remember anything.
Linda," Baby parties aren't for the babies, Candace. They're for the moms."
Candace, The moms?
Linda, So they can feel rewarded for all the hard work they do.
Candace," (scoffs) Toddlers are easy. They eat, they poop, they sleep. End of story."
Linda," You're a laugh riot, Candace. (starts to leave) Think you can handle watching Phineas and Ferb today?"
Candace, Piece of cake.
Linda, Have fun.
Candace, Hmm. Time to be in charge.
Phineas, So what you're saying is that we should never cut the red wire first.
Candace," Okay, you two, I'm in charge and I'm gonna lay down some rules!"
Phineas," Okay, shoot."
Candace," No leaving the yard, no amusement park rides, no robots, no rocket ships, (in background) no time chairs, no remote-controlled llamas, (onscreen) no first edition issuing of commemorative coins, no asking where Perry is, no astrological planetary alignments..."
Phineas," (While Candace is talking) Ferb, are you getting all of this? (Ferb holds up a miniature tape recorder) Cool."
Doofenshmirtz, Surprise! It's me! I've taken over the OWCA!
Major Monogram," Oh, no, he hasn't, Agent P."
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, spoilsport."
Major Monogram," Doofenshmirtz claims to have given up evil. He even signed this ""I Give Up Evil"" affidavit to apply for work at the agency. And normally, we could have rejected him because he's not an animal, but it turns out he was adopted by ocelots, making him, in the eyes of law, an ocelot."
Major Monogram," Sorry to do this to you, Agent P, but we're making Doofenshmirtz your responsibility during his probation period. Show him the ropes, and, uh, don't let him out of your sight."
Doofenshmirtz," You're probably wondering why I suddenly decided to quit evil and become a good guy. Well you see, I'd just built an inator. I called it the Babe-inator! No, it's not what you think. It's purpose was to transform my brother, the Mayor, and all of his cronies into a bunch of crying babies. That way I could take City Hall like babies taking candy away from... whatever they take candy... Aw, you know what I mean. Anyway, the Babe-inator was ready to go, so I took aim at my brother's office and pressed the button, but it didn't work! It didn't work for, like, the hundredth time! My evil plan did not work! And I thought to myself, ""Maybe I'm just not good at being evil."" That's when I had my epiphany. From now on, I'm going to be a good guy! So, here I am!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, my own cubicle. (Agent Kitty joins him and Perry) How nice! I'm gonna put a poster, right here, with a kitten that says, ""Hang in there."" (Doofenshmirtz turns and sees Agent Kitty; chuckles awkwardly) No offense. It's not like I think that's all you guys do, or anything. (Agent Kitty walks off) Oh, great, now he's going to Human Resources."
Norm, Oopsies! Better plug this in!
Candace, And no invisible paint.
Candace," Oh, my gosh. I don't know how you turned yourselves into babies, but that is sooo bustable! (Holds up her phone) Smile and say, ""Hi, Mom!"""
Candace," Now, you two are so... (Gasps) Where did they go? (goes off-screen and Ferb comes on) Come back here! No, put the power drill down!"
Candace, You stay right...
Candace," Ferb! No, get back here with my phone."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, would you look at that! Newton the Gnu is Agent Silent G. Whoo! I have to blog this. (Notices agents walking by with cups of coffee) Hmm, must be a coffee break. (Computer screen starts blinking saying ""security breach"" and he turns it off without looking)"
Candace, Find the picture and send.
Linda," Oh, they used to be so cute."
Candace," ""Thanks for the old baby picture."" (Sighs) Ooh, wait! I need something with today's date on it. I could take a picture of them with one of those old-fashioned things. It's like a web page with... printed on paper... A newspaper! Ha-ha! (Runs around trying to get Ferb to hold the paper) Okay, stop and hold the paper. Ferb, sweetie? Okay, just stand here and... No! No, don't run away! Wait! Hold it! No, no, no, no. Get back here. How about if we just sit? Then hold the paper. (Ferb throws it) We don't... We... No, don't throw it. Wait! (Candace gives up on Ferb and goes to Phineas) Okay, just hold this. Stay."
Phineas, Gah! (Throws the paper)
Candace," Phineas, no! No throwing. (Phineas crawls to her phone) We use our... (Phineas licks her phone) Ew! (Phineas throws it and it hits Candace) Ow! (Candace tries again on Ferb) Okay, hold this, Ferb. Now, I'll just... Where's my phone?"
Phineas, Gah! (Throws her phone into a bird bath)
Candace," Okay, fine! Okay, if pictures won't work, I'll just take you to Mom myself! I know we have an old stroller around here somewhere. (Candace finds a stroller and straps in Phineas and Ferb and they fall asleep) That's it, go right to sleep. You'll be busted in just a little bit."
Doofenshmirtz," So then, the duck says, ""got any grapes?"""
Doofenshmirtz," Uh-oh, it looks like, uh, coffee break's over."
Major Monogram," Enter. (Doofenshmirtz and Perry enter) Agent P, we have a situation."
Doofenshmirtz, Is this about that grape joke? Who told on me? Was it the duck?!
Major Monogram," That's not why I called you in. Get a look at this. This is Newton the Gnu. He was assigned to Dr. Diminutive, but it seems some bonehead blew his cover on the blogosphere."
Major Monogram,"We still haven't found out who it was. In the meantime, we need you to bring him in. Get on it, Agent P, and, uh, take Doofenshmirtz with you."
Doofenshmirtz, A ride-along? Sweet! I can wear my new fedora!
Major Monogram," Get out of here! (Doofenshmirtz and Perry leave and Carl walks by with a mail cart) Carl, get in here! When you're done delivering the mail, I want you to wash and wax my car. You know, a little wax on, wax off? It'll teach you karate!"
Carl," No, it won't."
Doofenshmirtz," I am loving this! We're all like partners, now! Like Jack and Jill, or Alice and Wonderland! And with a super-cool vehicle!"
Major Monogram, Be careful out there... (looks at Carl) ...washing my car. Don't scratch it.
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, look at these buttons! What does this one do? (he pushes a button which launches a missile) Whoa! Oh, yeah, this is way cool!"
Major Monogram, DOOFENSHMIRTZ!
Candace, (chuckles) Wait till Mom sees you guys. (Baby Ferb starts crying) Shh!
Candace," I didn't do anything! He's my brother, just a baby. They cry you know. (Now Baby Phineas start crying now he cried with him then puts Ferb back his stroller) I know! Toys! I buy you some toys; that's what makes babies stop crying! (pushes the stroller towards a store that coincidentally sells baby things) Oh, thank you. (the stroller gets stuck in the door) I'll just be a second, okay? Don't go anywhere. Stay!"
Doofenshmirtz," This apartment seems familiar. Hey, do you mind if I kick down the door? (he does so, proceeding to get his foot stuck)"
Dr. Diminutive," (opens door) Ugh, Doofenshmirtz?"
Doofenshmirtz, Awkward!
Dr. Diminutive, Why are you wearing a fedora?
Doofenshmirtz, I'm a good guy now! I believe you've met my partner?
Dr. Diminutive, (gasps) Perry the Platypus? Stay away from me!
Dr. Diminutive, (laughing) Fools! That was only my hologram!
Doofenshmirtz," Don't worry. I've got your back, partner."
Dr Diminutive, (traps Doofenshmirtz and Perry) I trapped you in a particle bubble from my new Photon 2000 Particle Bubble-erator!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, brother! 2000 was so 4,000 days ago!"
Dr. Diminutive," Perhaps you'd like to join your friend, Newton the Gnu in his decidedly ordinary acrylic prison. Can you believe it? I was having him over for a friendly dinner, when I read your blog telling me that Newton the Gnu is really Agent Silent G!"
Doofenshmirtz, I can't help it! I blog what I see!
Candace, I've got some baby stuff!
Candace," Oh, my gosh! Get back here!"
Robber," (coming out of store with bags of money) Suckers! (chuckles) Oh, my bike. (the police pull up) Oh, good, the cops are here! I can report this vandalism to the..."
Police, Put your hands up!
Robber," (he does so) Oh, that's right."
Candace," Phineas and Ferb, get back here!"
Phineas/Ferb, (cooing)
Candace," Okay, playtime's over. We've got a party to get to."
Dr. Diminutive," Due to your request, Heinz, I've decide to let you all go. From 40 stories up."
Doofenshmirtz," Just for the record, that's not exactly what I meant."
Dr. Diminutive," Yeah, I know. (drops them off of building)"
Doofenshmirtz, (as he and Agents P & Silent G fall) What do you guys think? How am I doing so far?
Dr. Diminutive," Hey, give it back!"
Dr. Diminutive," Uh-oh. Oh, poop."
Doofenshmirtz," Hang on, boys! I'm gonna bounce us back to headquarters! Yee-haw!"
Carl," Sorry about your car, sir. (presents a hubcap to Major Monogram) This is all I could find. (gasps)"
Major Monogram," Oh, this is just not working out!"
Candace," Hey, Mom! I've found a couple of babies that you need to see!"
Ginger/Adyson," Babies? Oh, let me help! We'll take good care of them!"
Candace," Uh, what are you guys doing here?"
Isabella, We're helping Mom's aunt's sister's landlord son.
Linda," Hi, Candace."
Candace," Mom, I need to show you something."
Major Monogram," It's humiliating! I'm stuck in this crummy, little cubicle while my office gets repaired! Anyway, Agent P, due to your quick action and decisive action, you were able to rescue Agent Silent G. Doofenshmirtz, you're fired."
Doofenshmirtz, Is it because I blew up your car?
Major Monogram," No, it's because I have a list of complaints from Human Resources."
Doofenshmirtz," So, it was the duck! (Looks at the duck. The dog and crocodile do the same)"
Major Monogram, Let's face it. You've done more damage inside the Agency than you ever did outside.
Doofenshmirtz," So, what you're saying is that I'm good at being evil after all! (calls Norm) Norm, we're back in business! Dust off the inators! (hangs up) Later, chumps!"
Norm, I'll start with this one!
Candace," Mom, these aren't babies that look like Phineas and Ferb. This is Phineas and Ferb."
Candace," (talking loudly) Okay, I get it. Lesson learned. Toddlers aren't easy! The irony is not lost in me! Little help here? Ugh, this had better wear off before the next episode."
