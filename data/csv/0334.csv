Doofenshmirtz, I can't believe it! Just moments away from finally achieving full control of the Tri-State Area!
Doofenshmirtz,"And I owe it all to you, Perry the Platypus, my trusted butler."
Major Monogram, I won! I won!
Carl, No! Why didn't you listen?! Why?!
Doofenshmirtz," Quiet, you! I will not let you ruin this moment of pure joy!"
Computer, Joy located.
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, my gosh! Everybody, it's Li'l Saul and the Breakingham Palace Crew!"
Li'l Saul," Oy, poi, poi and a deetle, deetle, deetle!"
Doofenshmirtz, (Dancing) This party's gonna be off the hook!
Carl, It's not how it looks!
Linda," (enters the apartment) Uh, I think this is your... hat. I'll just be leaving now."
Linda,"Well, this day couldn't get any weirder."
Linda,"Well, I'm about to be proven wrong. (at Candace) Hi, Candace."
Candace," (In backyard) Mom! Mom! The cheese mountain remains, but the people have fled en masse!"
Linda, (Getting into elevator) What are you talking about? What people?
Narrator, 5 minutes earlier.
Major Monogram," Come back! Wait! High five! Hey, don't leave me hanging!"
Candace, (Talking on phone) Mom! Cheese! Huge! Scary! Home! Now!
Major Monogram, High five!
Candace, What happened to that guy?
Narrator, 15 minutes earlier.
Carl," (Talking to Monogram via wrist communicator) Sir, I think Agent P is working for... Sir? (Sees Monogram about to eat cheese in a contest at Cheesetopia) No! Don't do it! Don't do it!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Snatches Carl's wrist communicator and placing it on the table) We'll have none of that, Mr. Squirrel Man. Besides, you're too late."
Doofenshmirtz,"Ever since Perry the Platypus quit your agency to become my butler, I have been freed up to create my ultimate inator, the Vaporizer-inator! With my mind now clear, I stumbled upon a scientific fact."
Doofenshmirtz,"Every object on Earth, when heated to a certain temperature, evaporates! With this, I'll be able to vaporize things at will, and create all kinds of mayhem! I'm a genius! (At audience) For realsies this time. (At Perry) Now, to your station, Perry the Butler!"
Doofenshmirtz,"Get ready, boys! When this baby powers up, it's gonna get hot in here!"
Carl, (Looking away) Happy place! Happy place!
Doofenshmirtz," Let's find our first target. How about... all the sand at the beach! (Sees that nobody is at the beach.) Wait. Hey, where is everybody?"
Narrator, 25 minutes earlier.
Phineas," Wow! I think this is the biggest turn-out we had all summer. Eh, Buford?"
Buford, Yep. It couldn't get any cheddar than this.
Phineas," Oh, bravo! Bravo!"
Baljeet, How do you keep coming up with them?
Phineas," Showtime, Ferb!"
Crowd, Ooh! Ooh!
Phineas, (At crowd) Cheesetopia is now open!
Phineas," It's like Utopia, with cheese!"
Major Monogram," (In Cheesetopia, looking around.) Cheese? Cheese?"
Isabella, Our cheese eating contest is about to begin!
Major Monogram, Cheese!
Carl," (Via Monogram's wrist communicator) Sir! Oh, why isn't he answering?"
Carl,"Oh, Agent P. If only you had your hat."
Narrator, 20 minutes earlier.
Carl, Shoot!
Linda, That squirrel man dropped his hat. I should return it. I wonder what's he's doing up there.
Carl," Oh, well. I've got to find out what happened to Agent P."
Carl, (gasps; then ducks down)
Carl, (shudders; runs off)
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, and I just sprayed for squirrel men. (Doofenshmirtz activates a trap that Carl runs into.) Well, now, it appears that fate has dumped our mysterious guest like an immense pile of assorted ""cheeses"" onto the ""lawn"" of my evil lab. (pause) Yeah, I know it's a strange metaphor, but I stand by it."
Carl," Oh, Agent P, what have you been up to?"
Narrator, 25 minutes earlier.
Doofenshmirtz," Very good, Perry the Butler. The trash chute is right down the hall. (gasps; notices Agent P's fedora lying on the ground) Hey wait, you forgot... (Picks up fedora) Oh, look at this thing, huh? Such memories! All the adventures, the excitement, the pummeling, the thwarting... Oh. You know, I'm feeling rather sentimental about it. (Tosses Perry's fedora off the balcony) Oh, well!"
Man in Squirrel Costume," Man, am I pumped for Squirrel Con!"
Carl," Yeah! With everyone in costume there won't be any baleful looks of judgement. (Picks up Perry's fedora) Hey, this is Agent P's hat. There must be something wrong. (Calls Monogram through his wrist communicator) Major Monogram, we have a problem. (Shows Perry's fedora to Major Monogram) Look!"
Major Monogram," Well, that doesn't look good. You can clearly see your zipper in the costume!"
Carl, No! Agent P's hat.
Major Monogram," Oh, well, then, maybe you should look into it."
Carl," Me? Like a real agent? Yes, sir!"
Major Monogram," As for me, I'm off to Cheesetopia! (Shows Carl a Cheesetopia poster.) It's Utopia, with cheese!"
Carl," Sir, you remember what happens when you eat cheese?"
Major Monogram," Uh, I've been cleared by doctors. Anyways, good luck, Carl."
Carl, Yes! Squirrel Con will have to wait!
Man in Squirrel Costume, Poor guy. I finished my deliveries early so I wouldn't have to miss this!
Narrator, 6 hours earlier.
Man in Squirrel Costume," (In delivery truck, with squirrel costume next to him) Last delivery of the day!"
Phineas," (Behind truck, directing as truck places lots of cheese on the lawn) Okay! Just dump it right there like a caged guy in a squirrel costume! (At Ferb, who's standing next to him) What? I stand by that metaphor. (At Baljeet) All right, Baljeet, I need you to help Ferb with the foundation!"
Baljeet, (Rolling a cheese wheel as Ferb balances on it) I am on it!
Phineas," Isabella, you and the Fireside Girls spread the word!"
Isabella," (Salutes; is standing with other Fireside Girls as they all hold giant piles of pamphlets) Girls, get ready to get our Flyer Delivery Patches!"
Adyson, (As they walk off) Again?
Isabella," Is there something you'd like to say, Adyson?"
Phineas," And Buford, keep the cheese puns comin'!"
Buford," (Sitting on a pile of cheese, eating) Sounds Gouda to me!"
Phineas, Excellent!
Buford," (Sniffing) All right, who cut the cheese?"
Baljeet," (As he and Ferb cut slices of smelly cheese, wearing gas masks) Sorry."
Narrator, 2 minutes earlier.
Candace," (Talking on phone while sitting in front of her computer) And then I typed in LOL, but it came out LOP, and Jeremy thought I meant... (sniffs the air) What's that smell? I'll call you later, Stacy. (Hangs up and looks out window, seeing cheese delivery.) Cheese, huh? That warrants a call to Mom! (Perry flies by on his jet-pack as she begins to dial.) What was that?"
Narrator, 10 minutes earlier.
Phineas," Ah, cheese. (Noticing Perry's disappearance) Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning, Agent P. (Perry realizes the camera is zoomed in very close on Monogram's face.) Sorry about the extreme close-up. Carl's off today, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to work this thing. Anyway, we have reason to believe Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. Again, since Carl is out, I'll have to do the visual reference myself. (clears throat; begins to draw on pieces on paper, showing his pictures to Agent P.) He's recently purchased a small tux, a silver tray, and a pair of white gloves. Heh heh, I traced my hand for that one. Ooh, check this out! (Monogram draws details of a turkey on the hand.) Look, it's Agent T! (Perry glares then looks up in shock; Monogram leans down) What, too soon?"
Major Monogram, Cheese?
Narrator, 15 minutes earlier.
Phineas, Why cheese?
Buford," 'Cause cheese is cool no matter how you slice it! (Sees no one is reacting.) What, am I provolone on this?"
Phineas," No, I guess it's as good an idea as any. Nice cheese puns, by the way."
Buford, That's nothin'. I've already got a whole list of 'em.
Phineas," Besides, with the change in plans, we had nothing else prepared."
Isabella," Yeah, what did happen to your first invention?"
Narrator, 5 minutes earlier.
Candace," Wait, Mom, don't leave yet! Li'l Saul and the entire Breakingham Palace Crew are in here! (Knocking on invention) Come on, I know you're in there, Saul!"
Computer, (Beginning to shake) Joy located.
Candace, Uh...
Li'l Saul," (As invention flies away) Oy, poi, poi, poi and a deetle deetle deetle!"
Candace, (Calling back to her mom) Never mind! Have fun running errands!
Phineas," (Walking in the backyard with Ferb and his friends) But Saul and his crew were unemployed, and so I finally found them full-time in my celebration-seeking rocket. It hones in on joy, activates, and is guaranteed to kick any party up to an 11! Hey, where'd it go?"
Candace, Now ya know how I feel. (walks away)
Ferb," Well, wherever it landed, I hope they can handle a party of that magnitude."
Narrator, Back to the present.
Doofenshmirtz," I'm not sure I can handle a party of this magnitude! (At Perry) Either way, we've got enough power for the inator now, Perry the Butler, you'd better tend to the guests."
Carl," Agent P, (spills the drink on Perry's tux) how could you have turned to the dark side? How could you have forsaken all that's good and right to be that maniac's butler? You don't belong in that uniform! You belong in this hat! (Carl takes Agent P's fedora and puts it on Perry's head, who looks at it, confused.) See?"
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus! You have grape juice on your shirt. I can't have my manservant looking like a street urchin. You should go clean up before it sets. (Perry gives Carl the fedora back and walks away.) Ugh, it's so hard to get good help these days, even when you ride 'em like a bicycle."
Doofenshmirtz," (As the Butler-inator takes measurements of Perry) When my Butler-inator is finished with you, not only will you have a perfectly-tailored uniform and wig, but you'll actually think you are my butler! You won't even remember that you fight evil for a living!"
Doofenshmirtz," Man, you really kick this party up to an 11, man! (Perry knocks Doofenshmirtz to the ground.) Perry the Platypus, what's gotten into you? (Perry shows him the words on his chest.) ""Thait I live""? What's that, some new band? (Perry grabs a mirror and Doofenshmirtz gasps.) Oh, ""I fight evil""! Very clever. You wrote a note to yourself in the future. (Perry jumps at Doofenshmirtz again and begins to drag him across the floor.) I would not have predicted that."
Candace, Mom! Mom! Mom! Cheese! Cheese! Cheese!
Linda," Candace, you know, we do have a nice backyard. (At this point, Candace opens her eyes) Although, I never noticed that cheese smell before. (walks away)"
Doofenshmirtz, My inator!
Li'l Saul," (Looking at the joy meter on Phineas and Ferb's invention) Oy, the joy. It drops. Time for us to go already!"
Li'l Saul," (As the invention flies away) Oy, poi, poi, poi and a deetle, deetle, deetle!"
Man at party," Well, no Saul, no ball. Let's split. (All the people at the party begin to leave.)"
Doofenshmirtz," (Lying on the ground) Wait, wait. I was just about to break out the bubble machine! (Perry flies out of the building on his hang glider with Carl hanging from his feet as Doofenshmirtz yells after them.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And you, too, large squirrel man creature hybrid thing!"
Phineas," Huh. Who would've thought a high-fiving swollen guy would've scared everyone off like that? (Everyone notices Cheestopia is gone and gasps, running over to where it used to be.)"
Isabella, I don't get it. Cheesetopia was just here!
Buford," Huh, that's Swiss-picious! Well, I did it! A hundred cheese puns! (Seeing Perry walk up to them) Oh, and look, there's Perry! (Buford looks at the audience and bows.) And, scene."
