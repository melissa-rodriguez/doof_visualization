Phineas," Come on gang, let's get started on building our megamondo--"
Buford," Eh, no can do, Dinner Bell! It's family day, and the Van Stomms from the low countries are visiting. (walks away) Buford is out, G!"
Phineas, Well that's a bummer. But we can come over some workarounds. (to Isabella and Baljeet) So if you two--
Baljeet," No can do, Phineas. I am taking an eastern Indian cooking class. We are going to make goat vindaloo. If we can ever find a goat. (goat brays offscreen) Oh! There is one now. Gotta run! (runs away)"
Phineas," Well, good luck! (pauses) Well the plans will still work with just three of us."
Linda," (walks up) I'm afraid your plans will have to wait until after Ferb's dental appointment. (walks Ferb with her) Come on, honey, time to go!"
Ferb, All right.
Phineas," Wow, I've never seen Ferb so nervous. Hmm. Well I guess it's just the two of us, huh. (Isabella squeals excitedly with an exaggerated smile on her face.) Isabella, are you all right?"
Isabella," (slaps herself, acting normal) Oh. Oh yeah. We can spend the day together, that'll be fun! Whatever."
Phineas," Let's see; with only two of us, we'd have to reallocate some weight in order to... (pause) Huh. Well, maybe if we just reduce the amount of... (sighs) No, that won't fly either. Y'know, this is a lot harder without Ferb around."
Isabella, But he never says anything.
Phineas," It's not what he doesn't say, it's how he doesn't say it."
Isabella, Well I can get the Fireside Girl Manual for inspiration.
Phineas, That sounds great! Thanks.
Phineas, Wow! Even Perry's gone... but that's pretty normal.
Major Monogram," I see you've taken our new breakfast-themed lair entrance. It's the most important lair entrance of the day. Anyhoo, OWCA has surveillance footage of Doofenshmirtz raiding thrift-store dollar bins. Not sure if it's evil, but it's, just kind of pathetic. Get to the bottom of this, and stop Doof's potential poverty-driven criminal freakout. And um, how 'bout ya pick up a cup of coffee for him on your way over? It's on me. Use some petty cash. (Perry salutes, then leaves) I feel bad for the poor guy."
Gretchen," (offscreen, gasps) The Fireside Phone!"
Gretchen," Gretchen at the ready, ma'am! Commence debriefing!"
Isabella," Gretchen, we have a Code Pink! Romeo is alone! Repeat: Romeo is alone!"
Gretchen," Roger that. Don't panic, we're on our way."
Gretchen," (saluting) Reporting for duty, ma'am."
Gretchen, The troop is establishing the mobile tactical headquarters as we speak!
Isabella, Nice hustle. (She and Gretchen walk inside.)
Candace," I know, right? With Phineas and Ferb split up for the day, it's practically a vacation! (She passes by Isabella's house with the clubhouse next to it in the background.) Yes, I know we're already on summer vacation, Stace. I was just -- (Opens her eyes and turns around, notices the clubhouse) What? A Fireside Girls mobile tactical unit? Sorry, Stace, gotta go! (Hangs up and runs off.)"
Candace," Okay, what are you doing (Walks up to Isabella and Gretchen) and what has to do with my brothers?"
Isabella," Um... (Scoffs, cut to the other girls working on a scale model on a table, continues offscreen) it's...something of a delicate matter."
Milly, Romeo is all go!
Candace, Delicate?
Isabella," Well, you might not know, but I have a little bit of crush on Phineas?"
Ginger, (offscreen) Little being subjective.
Isabella," (dryly) Stand down, Fireside Girl."
Candace," (realizing) Totally get the crush thing! You know, I don't quite get the Phineas thing. I mean, you do realize his head is a triangle."
Isabella," (Sighs, romantically) Yeah, it's so acute!"
Candace," Whatever. I have got your back, sister. I will stay outta the yard, and keep Mom out of the way too. (Folds her arms) Like, that should be difficult."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, it's you, Perry the Platypus. (Perry presents him the coffee cup.) What? Oh, for me? (He takes it.) Oh, that's a nice gesture, thanks. (Perry walks inside.) A-and you even used the doorbell instead of just crashing through, like you usually do. Alright, really appreciate this, Perry the Platypus, 'cause you know, money's a little tight lately, I can't even rub two nickles together. (Cut to Perry standing on a white patch of floor, he continues offscreen) Although if I had two nickles, I don't think I could sit and rub them together. (While saying this, Perry stares at the screen, then eventually sinks into the floor.) Oh, oh yeah, you're trapped, Perry the Platypus, (Cut to him) it's quick hardening, non-dairy creamer. Like I said, I'm on a budget. I know what you're thinking, Perry the Platypus, how could this happen to such a (Close-up of a stern Perry, he continues offscreen) withed guy like Heinz Doofenshmirtz? (Cut to him) Well, my ex-wife Charlene is out of the country on one of those...Extreme Eco-cultural Exploration Vacations. I -- I don't know what they do on those trips, but I imagine it's (crossfade to a still image of Charlene zip-lining with money flying out of her pocket, he continues offscreen) very expensive. (dissolve to her kayaking) Ugh, she's got some nerve! (cut to her hula dancing) That's -- that's my alimony she's throwing away! (cut back to he and Perry, he's showing him the images on his phone) And the worst is, she keeps texting me these pics! (puts it in his pocket, it beeps and vibrates) Oh, come on, really?! (walks offscreen) Anyway, the problem is I've already spent this month's alimony on my new -inator and -- (cut to him walking towards his new inator) and now I don't have enough money left to send Vanessa to the Grievance movie marathon she wants to see, and they're playing all the Grievance movies in order. They've got The Grievance, they've got Grievance 2: The Gripe, Grievance 3: Bone To Pick, and Grievance 4: The Revenge of the Italian Jug Band. You know, I don't think that last one is canon. Oh, what kind of father am I? Oh, oh, the shame is overwhelming, I can't even enjoy using my new Teleport-inator! (Music sting plays, ominous timpani follows) Nah, nah, I'm just not in the mood. Maybe tomorrow."
Doofenshmirtz," And it was such a stellar plan, too. I was gonna use it to send City Hall, and consequently my brother Roger, back to Drusselstein, and out of his mayoral jurisdiction. No fuss, no muss, just bzzt, and he's gone, instantly. (Cut to Perry, who counts down on his fingers.) Ugh, if only if it were that easy to get Vanessa to the movie theater, wait -- (Perry points at him.) hey, wait a second! (looks at the giant dial on the inator) I could just add another setting to my Teleport-inator and send Vanessa directly to the theater, and completely bypass those ridiculously inflated movie ticket prices. Oh man, am I good! That deserves a victory sip. (drinks coffee) Egh! Wait—what is this, decaf? (cut to a put-out Perry) It's like you don't even know me!"
Gretchen," (from inside) Alright, Fireside Girls. (cut to her in front of a computer and speaking into a microphone, Ginger stands next to her) Initiating Operation: Perfect Picnic."
Isabella, (into her earpiece) Roger that! (opens gate and walks in)
Candace," Well, looks like the operation is in phase two and I am gonna make myself scarce. (Stands up) Cadet Flynn is out, peace! (walks away)"
Isabella," Here we go. Let's just take a look -- (gets a thoughtful look, sounds like a valley girl) You know, I'm kinda hungry."
Phineas," Well then, why not just have a picnic?"
Isabella," (acting) Well. What a great idea! And I just happen to have... (shows picnic basket, singy-songy) a picnic basket right here!"
Gretchen," Ooh, she's good."
Phineas," Wow! Way to be prepared, Isabella!"
Isabella, (acting) Just doing my Fireside Girl thing! I packed it with some Mexican-Jewish delicacies like... (she shows a cheesecake like meal with a gelatin fish head.) gefilte-flan! (close up of it) It wobbles.
Phineas/Isabella, Eww! (laugh)
Phineas, That looks ridiculous!
Holly, Oh no! We've got a Code Irving!
Gretchen, Strike team deploy!
Isabella, Let's see what else I've got.
Phineas, Did you hear something?
Isabella, Nope!
Ginger, (salutes) Mission accomplished!
Irving," Hello, ladies! (purrs)"
Doofenshmirtz," The fox hops over the log...the rabbit crawls under the log... (ties wires in a bow, closes compartment) okay, got it! Now, to send -- (falls off) Ahem. And now, to send my daughter to the movies! (horror music plays) Aw, you see, it's just doesn't work in this instance. You know what, you guys just take the rest of the day off."
Slack #3, Want to go see a movie?
Slack #2," Yeah, sure. How about Grievance 4?"
Doofenshmirtz," Hey Vanessa, Pumpkin Pants. Can you come in here for a second? (turns knob, Vanessa enters) Good news, sweetie, I can send you to the movies after all!"
Vanessa," Really? Dad, it's no big deal."
Kids," ♪ Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo ♪"
Candace and Kids," ♪ Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo ♪"
Doofenshmirtz," I did it! (Cut to Perry, who looks up at the coffee cup. He continues offscreen) And now that my super dad status is intact, it's time to take care of business! (Perry hops over to the table and grabs the cup.) And by business, (Perry takes the lid off the cup) I mean evil. (Perry pours the coffee on the creamer block, melting it.) It's time to set my sights on (Cut back to him) on City H -- (Perry kicks him, he slides down the inator.)"
Male tourist," Hmm. (The vase and table appear in front of the painting.) Ohh, now I get it!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm. I didn't count on an oscillate function, Somehow I...I don't think this bodes well for my plan."
Isabella," (onscreen, acting) That's one of my own creations! I call it the Enchillatke!"
Phineas, (onscreen) It was delicious!
Dentist," Ah, here we are. (turns around, sees that Ferb's gone) Gladys, we have a runner."
Phineas," Hey, Ferb! You're back! (Ferb doesn't say anything.) Brilliant! (to Isabella) See what I mean, Isabella?"
Isabella," (acting, sounds a bit sad) Yeah, it's how he doesn't say it."
Phineas," Let's get to work, this'll be the biggest picnic ever! (walks off) I'll get the tools!"
Isabella," (into her earpiece) Alright girls, Union Jack is back. Operation: Perfect Picnic is now Operation: Ginormous Non-romantic Overblown Picnic."
Ferb, (with his mouth full of procaine) Ab flabahem abla flapabla.
Isabella," It's alright, big guy. You guys just do what you do."
Phineas," (runs into the scene, blueprints in hand) Looks like we're gonna need a change of venue. How 'bout the park?"
Doofenshmirtz," What do you know? No more Perry the Platypus. Transported to some random location somewhere. (Perry reappears and punches his nose, he disappears.) Ow! What -- (Perry reappears behind him, grabbing his head.) OW!! OWEY!"
Vanessa," Thanks for introducing me to the ironic enjoyment of Ducky Momo, Candace."
Candace," Ironic, yeah. Ha ha. So, your dad was really raised by wild ocelots?"
Vanessa," O.M.G., I wish that was (Candace suddenly stops walking and stares in shock.) the weirdest thing about my family. (Close up on Candace.) Candace? (Reveal she is looking at a picnic themed amusement park from Danville Park, she walks back to her) Oh, you know, amusement parks really aren't my thing, but... (walking away) Knock yourself out, girl! ♪ Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo, he's your very best friend! ♪"
Candace," Okay, I said I'd give them space for a romantic picnic, that is not a romantic picnic. That is Bust Town U.S.A.! (She enters the park.)"
Candace, ♪ Here is where I'll make my final stand ♪
Candace, (dialing phone) I am so gonna relish this bust! (answers it) Mom!!
Linda," Candace, it'll have to wait. I've gotta pick up Ferb from the dentist."
Candace, Mom! Ferb's here! At the park!
Linda," Oh, well, he must've gotten out early. I'm on my way."
Baljeet, Try our famous Tjinder family vindaloo!
Buford," No, no. Try our Van Stomm family bitterballen!"
Baljeet, (running) Try the vindaloo!
Buford, (also running) Bitterballen!
Baljeet, Vindaloo!
Buford, Bitterballen!
Baljeet," Hey, you got your bitterballen in my vindaloo."
Buford, And you got your vindaloo all over my bitterballen!
Baljeet, I wonder if these two great tastes will taste great together.
Buford, Nah. We should kill this with fire.
Baljeet, (pauses) Agreed.
Doofenshmirtz, (groaning)
Doofenshmirtz," What happened? Something just happened. I smell bitterballen. Where are we? (Perry lifts his hands off his eyes.) Hey, not bad, I can totally go for a mid-afternoon walk. (Perry hops onto the Teleport-inator and looks at the self-destruct button.) What are you doing? (Perry turns the knob to the ""home"" setting.) CURSE YOU PERRY THE -- !"
Candace," Over here, you gotta see this!"
Linda," (notices Phineas and Isabella) Oh, Candace, you're right."
Candace, I am?!
Linda, That is just adorable.
Candace, (turns around) What?!!
Phineas," Wow. I don't know where it all went. It's a good thing we brought our own basket, huh?"
Isabella, (acting) Yes. Yes it is.
Linda," Come on, Candace. Let's go home."
Candace, But but but—a whole park!!
Linda, Yup. (walks Candace away with her) And just the two of them.
Candace," (offscreen) I get it. But, ew."
