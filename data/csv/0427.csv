Phineas," Okay, guys, now you try it. (Isabella jumps over a hydrant on her skateboard.) Nice! (Baljeet does it next.) Very smooth, Baljeet! (A skateboard with no rider bumps into the hydrant.) What's the problem, Buford?"
Buford," Well, you know, the sun was in my eyes."
Isabella," Buford, what's with the lack of effort?"
Buford, I'm just tryin' to be careful.
Phineas, You?
Buford," Yeah, we're outta credit at the emergency room. My mom said if I break one more bone, she's gonna break the rest of them! Fairly sure that was hyperbole, besides, look how hard that hydrant is!"
Baljeet," Well, maybe we could make our own fire hydrants out of soft foam rubber."
Phineas," Hey, that's a great idea! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
Ferb, Seriously? That's it? A soft fire plug?
Phineas," Well, yeah, attached to a giant revolving treadmill with a giant soft neighborhood containing soft obstacles."
Ferb," Oh, yeah, okay."
Baljeet, Where is Perry?
Isabella, What did you say?
Baljeet, I was just asking where Perry is.
Isabella, Oh.
Baljeet, What did you think I said?
Isabella," Uh, well, I thought you said...uh...nevermind. It was too weird."
Major Monogram," Ooh, ooh, oh, get it off! G-Get it off! Ooh! Uh, just walked through a spiderweb. Don't you just hate that? Ya spend the rest of the day worried there's a spider on ya. (shudders) Gives me the willies. Anyhoo, our sources tell us there's a cowboy hat in front of Doof's building. Normally, that wouldn't be of any interest to us, since this is the week of the Danville Hootenanny, but it is a rather large hat and, in spite of its name, the Danville Hootenanny is a dignified affair. I wish I had more information, but Carl said there was a big bee by the surveillance equipment. So get out there, Agent P! Ooh! Carl, is there... (turns around revealing a huge tarantula on his back) is there a spider on my head?"
Carl," (offscreen) No, sir. There's no spider...on your head."
Narrator," Meanwhile, at the Danville Space Laboratory..."
Sign Painter," Laboratory?! (makes angry noises, throws his hat to the ground and stomps on it)"
Linda," Oh, Jack, it sure was nice of you to show Candace and me around. This satellite stuff is very interesting."
Jack," No problem, Linda. I'm flattered you'd be interested in our humble facility, considering your background in astrophysics."
Linda," Oh, yeah, uh, listen, that's kind of a secret, so don't—"
Jack," Oh, I'm sorry."
Candace, So what does your father do here?
Jeremy," Oh, he's part of a team that makes and manages recognizant satellites. They actually had a couple of rovers on Mars earlier this summer. But they suddenly stopped working. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
Candace," (nervously) Uh, how would I...heh heh...what do you mean? Heh heh."
Jeremy, All right...Your Highness.
Candace, (gasp) Who told?
Jeremy, Stacy.
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering why I'm cowering outside my lab. Well, day started like any other day. You know, ""how am I going to take over the Tri-State Area?"" But I suddenly remembered a movie that I saw long ago at a drive-in."
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) It was called Night of the Felis. I knew right away that the old masters were onto something. Imagine taking something cute and enlargening it to frightening proportions. Brilliant! But in order to take over the Tri-State Area, I had to study with some other types of small animals, preferably, something that could fly. And I vowed to get right to work...as soon as the movie was over. The first thing I needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger."
Doofenshmirtz, (in flashback) Eh?
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) I tried it out on my cowboy hat. It was a success! My ten-gallon hat had turned into a 2,000-gallon-hat!"
Doofenshmirtz," (in flashback) Whoa! (crash!) Well, that's the end of that hat."
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) Next, I had to genetically modify a mouse so it could fly."
Doofenshmirtz, (in flashback) Ow!
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) Then I decided it would be easier to just use a bat. So I ordered a retired stunt-bat from a low-budget bat circus that had recently gone belly-up. You know...the economy. I was on the precipice of Tri-State Area domination. At last, I had the ultimate creepy soldier! (Derek the bat squeaks) And then I remembered, I had a very mild phobia of bats."
Doofenshmirtz, (in flashback) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) I also had a mild phobia of shellfish.
Waitress," (in flashback, offscreen) Here's your order, sir."
Doofenshmirtz," (in flashback, offscreen) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!"
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) But bats are worse.
Doofenshmirtz," (in flashback) Scram, you flying gerbil! (Derek squeaks) Amscray! (Derek squeaks) You're making me miss the hootenanny!"
Norm," (in flashback) Sir, I found your radio. It was embedded in the dashboard of your car."
Doofenshmirtz," (in flashback) Norm, don't just stand there! Do something about this bat! (The radio is thrown, and misses.) Really? That's your solution? Throw a radio at it? Whoa whoa! (cut to Norm about to throw a crowbar) Don't throw that! That's imitatable."
Norm," (in flashback, picking up the inator) What if I hit it with this?"
Doofenshmirtz, (in flashback) No no! Don't shoot it with that! That's my—
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) And I thought the bat was scary before when he was...tiny.
Doofenshmirtz," It was at that point that Norm and I decided to come out here. Plus the bat kinda looks like my cousin, Narthelliot, which, as you can imagine is weird for me. Isn't that about right, Norm?"
Norm, (crashed through a hole in the wall) It's even more horrible than it looks!
Phineas, Everybody got their helmets and boards?
Isabella, Yeah!
Buford, I'm ready!
Baljeet, I am ready!
Phineas," Okay, Ferb, fire it up! We're going to Foamtown!"
Isabella, Woo! Woohoo! Yeah!
Jack," And over here are the models of our robotically-operated rovers: the Mars rover, the Moonrover, and this is the Irish Rover."
Candace, You sent a rover to Ireland?
Jack," Well, we had to test it somewhere."
Jack," It took a couple of months, but we're finally starting to get some really great pictures back."
Doofenshmirtz," Thank you for the blanket, Perry the Platypus."
Vanessa, (offscreen) Dad?
Doofenshmirtz," Vanessa? Oh, no! Vanessa, get out of there! (Crawling inside) There's a huge bat on the loose!"
Vanessa," Really? (Sees Derek shrieking.) Wow, cool! It looks like your cousin, Narthelliot."
Doofenshmirtz," No sudden movements or loud noises, Vanessa!"
Vanessa," Dad, relax. It's just a bat. They just eat bugs."
Doofenshmirtz, But it's a very big bat!
Vanessa," Now, come on. J-Just stand up. It's time to face your fear."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, okay. (Derek snarls at Doofenshmirtz and grabs him in his mouth.)"
Vanessa, (hitting Derek) No no no! Bad bat! Spit him out!!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, gross! (Derek grabs Doofenshmirtz with his feet and flies away.) Oh, yeah, this is much better!"
Vanessa," Dad!! Oh, hey, Perry. I was wondering if you could help me. (Perry grabs his jetpack and activates it.) Thanks, Perry. You're a peach."
Bat-Looking Man," So, what'd I miss?"
Vanessa," Oh, hey, Narthelliot! We were just talking about you."
Jack," Of course, even better than using a rover, we have these. We call them global surveillance satellites. No matter where you are on Earth, there's always one of these flying above you in orbit, streaming live video to us here."
Woman at Monitor," That's right. Here's the outside of our building right now. And we can look up any location instantly. The Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal..."
Linda, So you could look down on anybody's backyard and see what they're doing?
Jeremy," Pretty cool, huh?"
Candace," Wow, that's gotta be handy for something."
Jeremy, And three...two...one... (points to Candace in anticipation of her busting idea)
Candace, What?
Jeremy, Really? Alright.
Doofenshmirtz," Whoa! Oh, I get it! This is what it does! Flying through a hoop! That's what I get...for buying a bat...from a defunct...bat circus!"
Jeremy," So, having fun yet?"
Candace," Oh, you know I am. (Sips her drink)"
Jeremy," You know, my dad goes on and on about the cafeteria here, and I think he's right. This food is..."
Candace," (does a spit take and gasps) I've got an idea! My brothers are probably building something in our backyard right now, and we can use the surveillance satellite to catch them doing it! (runs off) Come on!"
Jeremy, I was wondering how long that would take.
Candace," Just lemme punch in my address... (The backyard and Foamtown appears onscreen.) Omigosh, I knew it! Look at that thing!!"
Jeremy, Wow! What is it?
Candace," it's an eye-in-the-sky bust! Come on, let's go get my mom! (they walk off)"
Phineas," Okay, Ferb, turn it off. Let's take a little break. (Ferb pulls the lever and the wheel stops rolling. Buford falls off of the wheel landing on his back.) You okay, Buford?"
Buford, I'm havin' the time of my life! Is anybody else hungry?!
Isabella, I am!
Phineas, C'mon! Let's go see what's in the kitchen. (The gang jump off the wheel.)
Doofenshmirtz," Oh no! Oh no no no! Not again!!! (bang!) Ow, my head! (bang!) Ow, my head again! (bang!) Ow! Now I forgot math! (bang!) Ow! There goes social studies! (bang!) Oh, good, they're back! (Doofenshmirtz's head crashes into the giant bolt revealing the cogs, which loosen and cause Foamtown to roll away.)"
Candace," This way, Mom! (motions toward the screen) See for yourself!"
Linda," Oh, wow! It's our house! (the screen shows the empty backyard and the kids) And you can see the boys! And their little skateboards! (waves) Hi, boys!"
Candace," They can't hear you, you know."
Linda, I know. (keeps waving) Hi! Whoo-hoo!
Phineas," Hey, Foamtown's gone."
Buford, You say that like it doesn't happen every day.
Baljeet, And you say that like an angry old prospector.
Buford, What does that even mean?!
Baljeet, (walks away) I stand by that metaphor.
Old Coot," Finally, Daisy, we're here. Our new home! Lotsa elbow room and no one to bother us! The last frontier! A place where a man and his donkey can— (Foamtown unravels.) Dangit! Come on, Daisy, we're headin' west."
Doofenshmirtz," Perry the Platypus, welcome to St. Louis! Now do something about this bat, please! (Perry shoots the inator at Derek and it shrinks back to its original size, leaving Doofensmirtz hanging in midair, then falling.) Aah!! Well, at least I lost my fear of bats!! (Doofenshmirtz crashlands into a shellfish restaurant.)"
Waitress," (offscreen) Oh, it's you again."
Doofenshmirtz, (offscreen) Aaaah!! Go away go away go away!!!
Waitress," (offscreen) Oh, just stop it."
