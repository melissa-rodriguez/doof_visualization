Buford, See? Isn't this the coolest game ever? It's called Jump and Duck.
Phineas," Hey, how'd you get your face in there?"
Buford," Easy. I just use this camera, see? (takes picture of Phineas)"
Phineas, (with spinning eyes) Cool.
Buford," (demonstrating how to add in the picture, tilting the game controller and wildly pushing buttons) And then you do this, and this, and this and this and this and this and this, and this, and this, and this, and this and this, and then this and this, and then that."
Buford, Look!
Phineas, This is awesome.
Candace," (on her cell phone) Stacy, you are talking to the luckiest girl in the house. Jeremy is taking me to the summer cotillion! Cotillion. It's like a dance. Yes, it's a real word. All I know is it's gonna be great. Wait, I just thought of something, two somethings actually. And one of them is pointy. Stacy, I'll call you back. It's time for a little preemptive bust."
Phineas," So, beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game?"
Buford, It's called Jump and Duck. Duh.
Baljeet, I can see no educational value in this game.
Buford, (at Baljeet) Duck!
Buford, (Laughing) Consider yourself educated.
Baljeet, I stand corrected.
Phineas," Far be it for me to cast dispersions on jumping, and or ducking, but I think you can improve this. With a little effort we could-"
Candace, (Now in the backyard) Okay. What are you guys up to?
Phineas, Playing a video game.
Candace, That's it? That's all you're doing today? Huh. How normal. I guess my night's safe after all. Who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game? I'm going to go get ready.
Phineas," (Angelic chorus in the background) ""Sucked into a video game"". Brilliant! Ferb! I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Good morning Agent P. I've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's internet activity. First, we know what you're getting for Christmas. Don't ask our lips are sealed... it's a vase. Second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all, Velour. Ugh! (Monogram shudders, and the feed cuts out)"
Background singers, ♪ Perry! ♪
Phineas," Introducing the all new and improved, Jump and Duck. The world's first truly immersive video game experience. Hey Ferb, throw the switch."
Candace, (in her room) Hey!
Phineas, And once your zapped into the video game by the digitizer-
Candace," Okay, what's going on? I was drying my hair."
Phineas," Sorry about the power, Candace. Ferb went to check the circuit breaker."
Candace, Jeremy is going to get here any...
Candace, (in the video game) ...minute. Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Phineas," We didn't go anywhere, but you're inside the video game."
Candace, What do you mean I'm in the... (Birds and angry fruit begin chasing Candace)
Phineas," Wow, cool. How come she got to go first?"
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Perry the Platypus, you are too late. Wait, is it eleven o'clock yet? (Pauses for a beat) Now! Now you are too late. So Perry the Platypus, tremble in fear before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known! The ball gown-inator. (Doofenshmirtz grabs the Ball gown-inator, and fires it at Perry, leaving him in a ball gown. Perry tries to jump at Doofenshmirtz, but falls due to his ball gown. A pair of mechanical arms pick of Perry so that he is at Doofenshmirtz's level) See, Perry the Platypus? It's hard to fight when you're in a ball gown. It's portable too. Ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion. It's a word, it means dance. So, why would I created such a device as this?"
Doofenshmirtz," (Narrating) You see, back in Gimmelshtump in the depths of my childhood, my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, I was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year. Drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates."
Doofenshmirtz," Now with my ball gown-inator, I will be the manliest man in the Tri-State Area! You know, by comparison. Because everyone else will be wearing dress. After I shoot them with my ball gown-inator. Am, am I over explaining this? Because I have this whole musical number prepared, and... Oh, oh you're good. (at the dancers) Take five girls."
Candace, You guys better get me out of here. I still have to get ready.
Phineas," Well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss, but you know just, just continue screen right."
Candace, Can't you just press a button and get me there now?
Phineas," Oh, you want cheat codes. No, we don't roll like that. Just jump and Duck. (Candace gets hit by fruits) Okay not necessarily in that order. Just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the approaching fruit."
Phineas,Candace What does that even mean?
Phineas," Duck! (Candace got hit by the door) Now run! (Candace gets hit by a ramp) Duck! (Candace's head got sucked) Okay, you can try to jump here (Candace fall on a platform) Duck! Duck! Duck! (Candace falls on the stairs) Okay stop falling Candace keeps falling) stop falling (Candace keeps falling) (talking to Ferb) Sheesh. Maybe we should go help her. Don't worry Candace, we're coming!"
Candace," Hmm, maybe they should call it Jump, Duck, and Blow (Candace then begins to run through the world, shooting everything in her path)"
Phineas," Whoa, what happened here? Oh that's right, Candace has her hair dryer. We'll just follow the carnage."
Doofenshmirtz," You know, Perry the Platypus, that dress sort of suites you. If you know, you just eventuate the positive as they say... Um, I'm going to stop talking now, I'm moving into a weird-"
Doofenshmirtz," (Muffled by Perry's dress) Hey what the...? What going on here I got... Oh, it's on now!"
Doofenshmirtz," (Hanging under the balloon) Oh great, now everyone's staring."
Phineas," Wow, the castle. Nice art direction, Ferb. I guess Candace already made it to the boss level. (The boss, designed after Buford appears behind them) Sweet! Come on."
Phineas," I forgot that we made Buford the boss. It's a little disturbing having him trying to obliterate us, but it made him so happy."
Candace," Hey ugly! Drop the twerps you freak. (The Boss does so, and walks toward Candace) Nobody picks on my brothers but- (The bosses knocks Candace over, causing her to lose the hair dryer, and diminishing her health)"
Phineas, Candace look out!
Phineas," Alright Candace, way to--"
Candace,Phineas! Ferb! Phineas! Ferb! (The two brothers dissolve) NOOOO!!!! (Phineas and Ferb re-digitize behind Candace)
Phineas," Hey Candace, what's the matter?"
Candace, You guys are okay?
Phineas," Well yeah, we have, like four lives left."
Candace," Wait. You guys let me believe you were really dead? If we ever get out of here you're going to be so... Hey, what's going on?"
Phineas," Awesome, we're out. So you must have beat the boss."
Candace," Yeah, it was a piece of cake."
Phineas," Cool, how'd you get him the second time?"
Candace," What do you mean, ""second time""?"
Phineas," You know how after you defeat him the first time, he comes back, and this time he's twice as strong? What'd you do then?"
Candace, Um...
Phineas, The last level's in the real world. Run!
Buford," No guys, he looks like a nice guy."
Buford," Okay, maybe not."
Baljeet," (Mockingly) Oh, now I see the educational value."
Buford," (Glaring) You know, eventually I'm getting out of here!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hehe, exactly as planned."
Isabella, (From behind the boss) Hey you!
Phineas, Isabella! No!
Isabella, Leave my friends alone!
Phineas, NOOOO!
Isabella, (Takes out a camera) Smile.
Phineas," Wow, Isabella, that was great."
Isabella," You know what they say, the bigger they are the harder they de-pixelate."
Doofenshmirtz, Sea-Foam-Green? I'm actually more of an Autumn.
Jeremy, (In the distance) Candace.
Candace, Oh no! Jeremy's here. How am I going to get ready in three seconds?
Ferb," Apparently, do what we did."
Doofenshmirtz,"No! (Perry takes out a pin, and pops the balloon, the jumps off, floating down safely by using his dress as a parachute)"
Doofenshmirtz, Curse you Perry the Platypus!
Phineas, I don't remember changing. Is this part of the gam-
Phineas," Oh, there you are Perry."
Candace, Well what am I going to do!?
Candace, Huh?
Jeremy," Wow, you look beautiful. ... I guess you all look beautiful."
Phineas," Thanks, we think it's part of the game."
Jeremy," ...Okay. Shall we go, Candace?"
Candace, Uh...yes.
Jeremy, Why do they call it a cotillion anyway?
Candace," Oh, don't get me started."
