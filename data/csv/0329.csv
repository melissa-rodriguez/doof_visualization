Buford," Aw nuts, I'm standing on Baljeet's shoulders and I still can't see anything!"
Baljeet, This is not how it works!
Phineas, Relax everyone. Ferb and I have devised a solution. Hop on.
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, Phineas and Ferb! And their friends! With technology that's slightly more advanced than what we have today. Mom!
Baljeet, You are doing it again!
Buford, It helps my arches!
Phineas," Look guys! It's Regent Monogram, and that girl must be... Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro!"
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Regent Monogram? When can I meet some of the local children?
Francis Regent Monogram," Princess, I'm afraid it's just not safe for you out in the wide world what with Doofus Khan on the loose."
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Doofus Khan! He has been a plague on our land for far too long!
Francis Regent Monogram, I promise once his forces have been defeated we'll throw you the biggest party money can buy. Of course it won't cost you anything because you're a hereditary monarch.
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Mom, wait till you see what Phineas and Ferb and their friends have done now! Look!"
Lawrence Flynn-Fletcher," Look, acrobats!"
Linda Flynn-Fletcher, Acrobats? I love acrobats.
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," No, Mom, over..."
Lawrence Flynn-Fletcher," (gasps) Oh no, Doofus Khan's warriors!"
Buford, He's going after the royal... thingy!
Baljeet, It is called a jou.
Francis Regent Monogram, See this is exactly what I was... The Princess!!
Phineas," Buford, get us down there! Quick!"
Francis Regent Monogram, The Princess! The Princess! Doofus Khan why that impertinent... (Gets hit by a taunting scroll) A taunting scroll? How uncouth!
General Carl," Should I order the final attack, sir?"
Francis Regent Monogram," No, no, General Carl. A full-scale attack now would put the Princess at risk. Oh, if only Master Perry had not given up the way of the warrior and gone to live a contemplative life on the Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness, he could retrieve the Princess. Oh, if only someone could reach him and tell him of our plight!"
Phineas," Hey guys, We know what we're gonna do today!"
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro," Doofus Khan, (budges free from the grip of two warriors) Regent Monogram will have your head!"
Doofus Khan," Regent Monogram will never attack as long as I have his Princess. Which should buy me all the time I need to complete my secret weapon and take over the Ten-Province area!? Meanwhile, I'm putting you in the penthouse dungeon. You'll love the view. Of course I've planted booby traps all along the way and I alone know how to avoid them.(He gets hit by a giant shoe) Heh. Must have forgot that one. (A step opens up and he notices a hammer) Oops! (The hammer shoots a laser at him) Oh, that's right. (The step opens again) You're supposed to skip this step. (He screams as he falls into a step. He gets burnt, and gets chomped on by piranhas) Everything's under control, but-- (The step opens once again and gets hit by a boxing glove) Testing the system-- (Various booby traps are activated as the camera pans to the top of the stairs) Hey, hey, it works. (Gets caught by a bear trap) Anyway, here you are. (Takes out a set of keys and tries the keys to open the door) You'll have a nice rack to sleep on and some rats to keep you company. (Opens the door)So while your here, enjoy your stay. Ta-ta Princess! (Slaps the door) I'll see you-- (Stairs turn into a chute)"
Phineas," There it is, The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness."
Buford, Ya know what I hate about The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness? Just to get there you have to cross the Uncrossable River of Uncrossableness.
Baljeet, Who named all these things?
Buford," That guy over there, The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness."
The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness, Hi there! Greetings!
Phineas, Okay. (The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness continues talking in the background) Ferb do we have anything for uncrossable rivers? (Ferb pulls out a grappling hook that looks like a crossbow)
Candace, What are they up to now?
Buford," Oh, that'll do. (He and Baljeet get on the carriage)"
Candace, (Growls)
Baljeet," Look, a Chinese eviscerating fish. Though I suppose here in China we just call them eviscerating fish. (Candace starts swinging across the rope)"
Candace, (Mocking Baljeet) Oh but here we just call them evilscerating... (Candace screams and falls into the river)
Buford, So how do we get up The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness?
Phineas," No worries, Buford. (Baljeet takes his hiking stick and leafs through his backpack) I think we have just the thing. (Pulls out a block of wood)"
Candace," (While wringing her hair) Oh, come on!"
Candace, (While climbing up the side of the mountain) Stupid Mountain of Stupidness!
Redundant Scribe of Redundantness," Actually, that was my original name for it! (Candace falls off the mountain into red clouds) Oops, my bad, sorry, my apologizes, mea culpa!"
Phineas," Master Perry the Platypus, (He and Ferb get out. Master Perry puts down the kite) This is a great honor. (He and Ferb bow)"
Buford, Wow. I can't believe he's a platypus.
Baljeet, Phineas pulled a jou with giant mechanical feet out of his backpack and that is what bugs you?
Phineas, Master Perry the Platypus! Doofus Khan has kidnapped the Princess and only you can save her!
Phineas," You mean you won't? But why, Master Perry the Platypus? What made you give up the life of a warrior hero?"
Phineas, What's he doing?
Ferb, That's a ripple dissolve. He must be having a flashback.
Phineas, Does he know we can't see it? Should we give him some privacy? I don't know the protocol for flashbacks.

All, ♪ Silk! ♪
Background singer, ♪ But I know a way we can make you a warrior ♪
Background singer,But that's just the general information. Here's some of the specific things you can look forward to in your workout...
Phineas," Are you sure you won't come with us, Master Perry? The kingdom really needs you back."
Buford, He's doing it again.
"Buford, Phineas, and Baljeet"," Goodbye, Perry."
Candace, You know I can't see anything right?
Phineas, Follow my lead when we get there; we're going right in the front door.
Buford, I knew we shouldn't have let Baljeet drive.
Phineas," Never mind that, you two stay here and fend off the guards, Ferb and I will rescue the princess."
Buford," We got it covered, just watch out for booby traps."
Phineas," We made it and completely unscathed. Good thing we brought along that yak bladder. Princess Isabella, we've come to rescue you stand away from the..."
Princess Isabella, My hero!
Phineas," Don't worry Princess, we'll take the banister down. It's safer."
Phineas, Holy mackerel! how did you guys defeat all these soldiers?
Random soldier, We're okay.
Buford, There was nothing to it.
Phineas, There's no time for flashbacks! We have to go!
Buford, What flashback? (They all run off) I'm just rippling! It relaxes me.
Doofus Khan," Well would you look at that a bunch of kids running away with the Princess... Running away with the Princess?!?! (Slides down a fireman pole) Oh, time to take matters into my own hands!"
Buford, What the heck is that?
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, It must be Doofus Khan's secret weapon. It's heading for the castle! What do we do?
Phineas, I've got an idea!
Francis Regent Monogram, Great googly moogly!
Doofus Khan, (Laughs) Amazing what you can do with a little bamboo and rice paper huh?
Francis Regent Monogram, Doofus Khan! What have you done with Princess Isabella?
Doofus Khan," That's none of your business, but there's no way she escaped forcing me to move up my plans I can tell you that!"
Francis Regent Monogram, You barbarian!
Doofus Khan, I know I am but what are you. (Dragon sticks out tongue) Hehe. You like that? The tongue set me back a week but it was totally worth it.
Francis Regent Monogram," Carl, duck!"
General Carl," No, actually sir I think it's a draw... (Carl gets slapped by the dragon's tail) Oh, that kind of duck."
Doofus Khan, (Laughs) Hyvertical remodeling!
General Carl, We can't take much more of this! What do we do?
Doofus Khan, Surrender! Oh what now? (A giant terracotta warrior starts marching towards them) A giant terracotta warrior? Roughly the same size as my dragon?
Doofus Khan," What could he possibly want? (Terracotta warrior goes to ""crane"" position) Oh he's doing that crane thing. (Terracotta warrior kicks the dragon in the face) You know, 4 centuries from now that move is gonna be real cliché. (Dragon breathes fire on the terracotta warrior) Of course, being terracotta you would be fire-proof. Okay, mono to mono (The robots fight) Ow that's not your mono!"
Regent Monogram," Man, they would love this in Japan!"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," What the? Phineas and Ferb, Doofus Khan and their friends too!!!! Mom!!!!!!!!"
Doofus Khan, (Laughs) Gotcha!
Baljeet, He has the key to our defeat!
Buford," You make puns when the other guy is down, dumbbell!"
Doofus Khan," Aww, poor babies feeling tired, huh? Allow me to put you to sleep! (Dragon picks up a building)"
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro," (Everyone gasps) Ew, who puts armpit hair on a mechanical dragon?"
Doofus Khan," Next time, don't put your wind up key in such an obvious place. I cleverly hid mine in a spot only an ancient warrior would dare to go. (It shows Perry coming down from the sky) No, Master Perry the Platypus! (Perry hits the dragon's nose) Hey, careful with the soft palette there! (Perry jumps into the dragon's mouth and rolls up the tongue revealing a wind up key. He chatters)"
Phineas," Ferb, the key! (Ferb shoots a grappling hook grabbing the key out of the dragon's mouth. Causing the dragon to deactivate and drop the building on itself) Uh-Oh! Eject everybody! (Phineas and the others jump out of the warrior as it and the dragon fall, over falling apart, just as Candace brings Linda over)"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn, (With her eyes closed) (laughing mancally) Look!
Linda Flynn-Fletcher," A giant mechanical terracotta warrior? Really, Candace? (she walks away) Wouldn't that be slightly more advanced that what we have today?"
Candace Candy Gertrude Flynn," Well, that would've been the point!"
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Regent Monogram!
Francis Regent Monogram, Princess!
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Party now?
Francis Regent Monogram, You betcha!
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Great!
Doofus Khan," Ah, well, back to the drawing board."
General Carl, Compliments of Regent Monogram.
Doofus Khan," Oh, I hate these things!"
Francis Regent Monogram, Well all's well that ends well. Maybe someday we will find a way to keep our fair lands safe from barbarian invaders.
Princess Isabella Garcia-Shapiro," You know, I think these blocks would make a great wall."
Phineas," Ferb, I know what were going to do tomorrow!"
Elderly Phineas," Well, that took longer than expected."
Elderly Ferb," But, it is a great wall."
Elderly Phineas," Yeah. So, what you wanna do tomorrow? (Ferb glares at him and then leaves) What? I kid. We can rest, how about a game of puzzles?"
