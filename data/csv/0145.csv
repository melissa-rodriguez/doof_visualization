Phineas, What should we do today? (First slide appears) Build an underwater skate park? Sounds pretty wicked! (Second slide appears) Fly with rocket-powered bat wings? Awesome! (Third slide appears) Teach Perry tricks. (He and Ferb looks at Perry) He's just a platypus. He doesn't do much.
Phineas," Oh, hi, Isabella."
Isabella," Hey, Phineas. You might wanna go check up on Baljeet. I was walking by his house and heard him scream... ""AIIIEEEE!!! I'M DOOMED TO BE AN INCOMPETENT FLUNKEE FOREVER!!! Ever...ever...ever..."" (pause) I added the echo part."
Phineas, Sounds pretty serious.
Phineas, Baljeet! It's Phineas and Ferb. (Opens door to Baljeet's room) Why are all the lights off?
Baljeet, Darkness is a shroud that hides my shame.
Phineas," (Turns on light switch) Hey, buddy, why don't you tell us what's going on."
Baljeet," Because of the 17 summer school classes I am taking, I qualified for the science fair. So I decided to design this."
Phineas, (Takes blueprint; he and Ferb holds it up) A portal to Mars? Cool!
Baljeet," No, not cool. (Grabs blueprint; rolls it up) When I showed my teacher, he said..."
Male Teacher, A portal to Mars? And what does it do?
Baljeet," Well, without over-complicating things, it's a portal to Mars. You step through it and you're on Mars."
Male Teacher," Well, this is very...creative. But, unless you can build a working model, the best I can give you is..."
Baljeet, An A-minus?! That would be the worst grade of my life!
Phineas, Why don't you just build one?
Baljeet," I am not mechanically inclined like the two of you. To truly understand my predicament, I feel it will be best expressed in a song. (Claps hands twice)"
Baljeet, ♪ From the mountains of the Himalayas ♪
"Phineas, Ferb, Baljeet", ♪ Puréed! (X2) ♪
Phineas, ♪ I know what we are going to do today! ♪
Baljeet," ♪ Good! With your mechanical inclinations, ♪"
Phineas," ♪ Wait, something just occurred to me! ♪"
Baljeet, Did you have him when you came over?
Major Monogram," Oh, uh...Agent P. (Clears throat) It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases. Chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda and lederhosen. Those leather bib-front shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? (Pauses) Man, he is one sick puppy."
Phineas, You're all set for the science fair tomorrow.
Baljeet," Inside I am thanking you a thousand times, even though on the outside I remain quite frugal."
Phineas," Wow, Baljeet, you're already set up."
Baljeet," (With a wide smile ""frozen"" on his face) I have been here since midnight waiting for everyone! I can't stop smiling! I have got cramps in my cheeks."
Phineas," Here, let me help you. There you go, buddy"
Baljeet," Ahh. Now I'll just hang out and ""be cool"" till my teacher gets here. (Wide smile appears on his face) Uh-oh, it is happening again!"
Candace," Oh, yeah, Jeremy, no one makes a corn dog like you."
Jeremy," Oh, hi, Candace. Nice binoculars."
Candace," (Chuckling nervously) Yep. Yep, they definitely are working. I--I just bought these for my dad and was just...uh, you know, making sure that they work, and they sure do. You can see really far away or really up close. (Notices poster on counter) ""Help wanted""?"
Jeremy, Yeah! You should apply. We could work together.
Candace, You mean side by side?
Wendy," Hi, there. I'm really really motivated! Really really positive! Really really high-energy! And would like to apply for the job."
Candace," Excuse me, I'd also like to apply for the job."
Manager," Ladies, I'm afraid I only have one opening. How about a competition to see who gets the job?"
Wendy," Sounds like a great idea to me. (At Candace) Good luck. (Extends hand; quickly takes it away) Ooh, too slow. I think I'll call you Molasses."
Candace," Molasses. Well, I think I'll call you something...slower than molasses, that's for sure."
Candace," This isn't part of the competition, is it?"
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, Perry the Platypus, welcome to my truck of doom. (Stops truck; Pushes a button)"
Doofenshmirtz," I suppose you're wondering why I'm wearing lederhosen. (Pauses; Perry glares at him) What? I've the legs for it! (Stretches right leg on dashboard) Eh? Eh? Eh? (Lowers right leg) Anyway, it will all become clear soon enough!"
Woman," (Growling, low-voice) Come on, Hansel! Move it!"
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, wise guy, I'm just explaining... Oh! (Chuckling) Sorry, madam. Sorry. (To Perry) Her voice was so masculine and growly. I thought it was a man."
Doofenshmirtz," I mean, people must call her ""sir"" all the time on the phone. It must be so em... (Laughs) She's standing right behind me now, isn't she?"
Doofenshmirtz," Not one word, Perry the Platypus."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, great! A line! (At a boy) Oh, brother! What is this, a model of Pluto? (Laughs) That planet doesn't even exist anymore, you moron!"
Male teen," Thanks for holding my spot in line, little brother. (To Doofenshmirtz) What were you saying about Pluto?"
Doofenshmirtz, Nothing. I'm sure it's...
Doofenshmirtz, (Groans; pulls model of Pluto off his head) I suppose you are wondering why I am putting myself through all of this.
Young Adult Doofenshmirtz," The movies are gray, the TV is black, the horses are running, please bring me some food."
Doofenshmirtz," (Voice over) Yet, curiously, I still lost to a baking soda volcano!"
Doofenshmirtz,"But never again! Behold! (Removes tarp) The world's largest baking soda volcano! I mean, it's got to be the biggest one here, right? It's gonna win. (Pauses) I feel confident."
Elderly man, Next?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, we're next."
Elderly man, Aren't you a little old to be entering this science fair?
Doofenshmirtz," No! What makes you say that? I mean, look at me! I'm wearing lederhosen!"
Elderly man, (Pauses) Okay. Go ahead.
Doofenshmirtz, (Chuckles; to Perry) See? I know what I'm doing.
Baljeet," (Cheerfully) Hi, Mr. McGillicuddy."
Mr. McGillicuddy," Well, I see you've built yourself a prototype, but the question still remains: Does...it...work?"
Baljeet," Well, I think..."
Phineas," Of course it works! Baljeet, fire it up."
Mr. McGillicuddy," Ok, so I see science fair."
Baljeet," Take a closer look, Mr. McGillicuddy."
Mr. McGillicuddy," Wow! A science fair on Mars! Baljeet, you have just validated my entire career as an educator! You get an A+++! (Voice squeaks) I'm gonna go get the judges!"
Doofenshmirtz, Soon I will show them the havoc created when an acid and a base combine! (Laughs; dramatic music) But first I have to find an outlet 'cause there's a nice laser show that goes along with it. We'll take this out and put mine in. (Chuckles) Hello!
Mr. McGillicuddy," It's right over here. (At Baljeet) Baljeet, show our judges what Mr. McGillicuddy has taught you."
Mr. McGillicuddy," Ah, um, just a moment. It takes the skilled hand of a master professor. (Chuckles) Hello! Mr. Martian! It's Mr. McGillicuddy. (Chuckles) Uno momento."
Judge #1, Who's up for corn dogs?
Judge #2, I am.
Mr. McGillicuddy," A-ha! Turn it all the way up to high. (Switches dial from ""low"" to ""high"") Yes! That should do it."
Phineas, I wonder what's wrong with the portal?
Baljeet," Ah, no matter. Actually, I never cared about winning. I just wanted a good grade."
Phineas," Aah. Well, who's up for corn dogs?"
Baljeet, Me!
Manager," Girls, your first task is to dress these dogs with ketchup and mustard. I'll be back in a bit to check your work. Good luck!"
Wendy, (Growls)
Candace," (Holds up a bottle of ketchup) Hey, no fair! I ran out of ketchup. (Squeezes the bottle, then grins sheepishly.) Oops. Now I'm out of ketchup."
Wendy, (Squeezes a bottle of mustard) Oops. Now I'm out of mustard.
Candace," (Squeezes a bottle of relish twice) Oh, look, I'm out of relish!"
Wendy, (Laughing)
Mr. McGillicuddy," It's gotta work, it's gotta...work! Huh? (notices the plug to the portal)"
Doofenshmirtz, Now just add some vinegar and... (Perry lands on his head; he screams)
Mr. McGillicuddy," It just wasn't plugged in. There's an outlet over there. (Notices a high voltage outlet; plugs the cord in, cackling) It's working! It's working!"
Doofenshmirtz," Ew, gross! I smell like...salad. (Mumbling; slips on vinegar; lands in the volcano, which then ""erupts"") Say goodbye to this pair of lederhosen. Hey, I'm unhurt! Yes, I am invincible! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where am I going?"
Judge #1," All right, so what was it you wanted to show us?"
Mr. McGillicuddy, (Stuttering) No! It was here!
Judge #1," Come on, let's go find a real winner."
Mr. McGillicuddy, But... But... But...
Girl," Excuse me, am I too late to enter?"
Judge #1, Are those mechanical arms?
Girl," Why, yes. I used them to make this baking soda volcano."
Judge #1, (Gasps) A baking soda volcano? Cool! 1st prize!
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, come on!"
Mr. McGillicuddy, But... (Back in the kitchen...)
Manager," Well, seeing as you've used most of my ketchup and mustard to dress yourselves, I'm afraid neither of you get the job."
Candace, Snail! I'll call you you Snail. Ha!
Wendy, You're quick. (In the mall...)
Isabella, I just can't believe you built a portal to Mars and didn't go through it yourselves!
Phineas," Oh, we did."
Ferb, But that's another story.
Phineas," Oh, look."
