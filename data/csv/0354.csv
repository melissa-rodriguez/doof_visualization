Isabella," Hi, Phineas! What'cha makin'?"
Buford," Uh, sawdust machine?"
Phineas, Nope. Take a look.
Isabella," Oh, they're adorable! What are they?"
Phineas, They're nano-bots!
Baljeet, Nano-bots? Can they be programmed?
Phineas," Sure, they can link up in virtually infinite configurations to make just about anything you can imagine."
Buford," So, impress me."
Phineas, Okay.
Buford," Yeah, yeah, main title, whatever. But I think I see the potential. Like, you could use them to make a giant birthday paddle."
Baljeet, Or a telescope.
Buford, Or a giant birthday paddle and a regular sized cheese grater.
Isabella, Or a scratching post for... HEY!
Phineas, I'm way ahead of you Isabella.
Major Monogram," Ah, Agent P. Welcome to the best noodle house in Shanghai."
Major Monogram,"Yeah, I know it's a long haul, but the local take-out just wasn't cutting it for my sophisticated palate. I just wanna tell you what Doof is up to, but I have no idea. I've been on the plane for 17 hours, and they don't let you use your cell phones till you land, and then I realized I didn't have international coverage, so... Anyway, you should probably get back to Danville, and check on him, just in case. Don't worry, I'll bring you back some white rice and soy sauce."
Phineas," All right gang, let's get techno-mimetic. (pause) Let's use technology to mimic..."
Buford, Why you gotta talk like that?
Phineas," You're right. Nano-bots, please."
Candace, What are you doing?
Phineas, We're making a car.
Buford, Buford loves that!
Isabella, That's awesome!
Buford, Helicopter! Helicopter! (Phineas zaps the nano-bots and makes a helicopter) Yeah!
Isabella, Yeah!
Buford, Yes! Bigger!
Phineas, Sure! We'll just need to whip up some more nano-bots!
Candace," Mom! Mom! Mom, the boys! Garage! look!"
Linda," Oh, they're making little models. How cute!"
Candace," You don't understand! It was nothing, and then it was flying and.. They made it out of dust!"
Linda," Oh, Candace, you're not even trying."
Candace," Okay, I need more information."
Norm," Welcome, Perry the Platypus. Would you like a muffin? They're fresh and yummy! Muffins stay warmest here, close to my heart. You must be here to see Dr. Doofenshmirtz! (Perry chatters) I'm sorry he's not in right... (beeping) Whoops, incoming message."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, hello, Perry the Platypus! Sorry I couldn't be there to capture you personally. I was called in for jury duty. But no big deal, I've got the perfect ""get out of jury duty free"" card! (Perry chatters) Relax, it's totally legit. Meanwhile, I'm leaving Norm in charge, the big lump. Hey, try to make yourself useful, Norm! Would it kill you to show some initiative?"
Norm, Show some initiative? You never asked me to do that before.
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, well, I'm out of your blast radius today, so surprise me, why don't you? Try not to be a complete disappointment."
Baliff, DOOFENSHMIRTZ!
Doofenshmirtz, Present!
Norm," Please enjoy your muffin! (Muffin traps Perry) Sorry for the inconvenience, Perry the Platypus. I'm showing initiative. When I help Dr. D take over the Tri-State Area, he will be so proud of me! Maybe then he will take me out for a game of catch! But how to do it? Dr. Doofenshmirtz makes complicated inventions which invariably fail. But I'm more results-oriented, so I'll just make a weapon!"
Candace, Okay. Commence Operation Concisely State What The Heck Is Going On Around Here. Notepad: check! Ducky Momo 15th Anniversary Happy Pencil: check! Keen eye and abominable will to bust: check!
Phineas," Okay, guys. Get ready for some Nano-bot morphing action!"
Buford, Wow!
Baljeet, Awesome!
Isabella, Great idea!
Buford," Hahaha, pig face. (Candace writes on her notepad and runs to the living room where Linda is)"
Candace," MOM! MOM! Phineas and Ferb are making a giant tape dispenser, but it's also a faucet, and a rowboat, a baseball hat, and gingerbread man with a fist for a head, and a pig face --"
Linda," Stop. Okay, your stories are always full of holes, but it's usually just one story. Here, let me demonstrate. I'll be the ""Candace"" and you will be the ""beautiful mother"". (Clears throat)"
Candace," (long pause) They'll probably do that, you know."
Judge," Juror number 9, state your occupation."
Juror number 9, I'm between jobs at the moment.
Doofenshmirtz, Ha! You'll never get out of jury duty with that story!
Judge, Dismissed!
Juror number 9, Man! I could've used this on my resume.
Judge, Juror number 10!
Doofenshmirtz, My name is Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. My occupation..(giggles)...evil scientist!
Judge, Mad scientist!?
Doofenshmirtz," (angrily) No. No. No, not mad scientist! I'm not angry. Evil scientist. There's a difference..."
Judge," Hold on, number 10. I think your background might lend a unique perspective to the case at hand. The State vs. Dr. Diminutive!"
Dr. Diminutive, I didn't do it!
Doofenshmirtz, Dr. Diminutive!
Dr. Diminutive," Doofenshmirtz, it's your fault that I'm here!"
Judge, (Judge bangs gavel on bench) Order!
Dr. Diminutive," He's the one who invented the Schmaltz-inator. Not me. I merely stole... I mean borrowed his device, and unleashed it's awesome power, unwittingly that is, upon the airwaves (Dr.Diminutive's lawyer slaps his face in embarrassment)."
Judge, Do you two know each other?
Doofenshmirtz, I have never seen him before in my life.
Dr. Diminutive, He lies! I have proof. The 2007 L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. pudding review.
Doofenshmirtz, Why would you carry that in your wallet? Why would he carry that in his wallet?
Judge, Order! Order!
Doofenshmirtz, Would somebody please tell me why he would carry that in his wallet!?
Candace," Okay, one story. And that one story is..."
Candace, Cars! (Phineas's car transforms into a jet) Planes! (Baljeet's car transforms into a UFO) Space ships! Crud!!!
Norm," (Carrying a blowtorch and wearing a welding helmet) At last, my ultimate weapon is complete. Would you like to see it?"
Norm, Get ready for a surprise! It's me! Dr. D will be so proud!!! Assuming he survives the cataclysm. (flies away from Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.) Have a nice day!
Norm," ♪ La, la, la, la ♪"
Doofenshmirtz, I'm just saying we only looked happy because we were singing. It's not a true representation of our relationship.
Norm, (In a distance from outside of the prison) Citizens of downtown Danville...
Norm, Pardon me for interrupting. You have two minutes to relinquish your city to me or see it utterly destroyed. Thank you for your cooperation.
Woman, What could we do?
Man, Utterly destroyed? That's like more than regular destroyed.
Man #2, But I just got a reservation at that new restaurant!
Woman #2, He was so jaunty when he was singing.
Doofenshmirtz," What? Weapons!? (angrily) Oh brilliant! Like nobody ever thought of that. I mean, you destroy the Tri-State Area and what are you ruler of? Rubble! And where's the panache? The je ne sais quoi?"
Dr. Diminutive, He's an amateur.
Doofenshmirtz, I'm not talking to YOU!!!
Norm," Attention Danville, while your nervous scurrying is gratifying, I must inform you that you have one minute to..."
Norm, (as he is being kicked in the face) Surrender!!!
Norm," This has been delightful Perry, but I have a schedule to keep! (Fires a blast from one of his weapons at Perry)"
Norm, This is what I dreamed it would be like with Dr. D! Catch!!!
Norm," Thank you, Perry. That was a deeply satisfying, emotional experience. And a well timed one coming only thirty seconds before you are destroyed along with the rest of Danville. A simple matter when you employ weapons and not one of those foolish inators. (beeping) Incoming message..."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey!!! Who are you calling foolish you ingrate! Boy, one successful bit for tri-state area conquest and suddenly he's full of attitude! I guess I should've expected that from a guy with a SQUIRREL FOR A HEART!!!"
Norm, Deep down he really likes me.
Norm, A giant acorn? How is that supposed to... (the squirrel operating Norm jumps out of him and leaps for the acorn) Oh! I see what you had in mind. Well played sir. (Norm winds down and falls down to the ground) Thank you for game of Catch. (Norm appears to explode before even hitting the ground)
Candace," So, you guys done changing things up around here?"
Phineas, Looks like it. We left the Nano-bot programmer here and now it's gone.
Candace," So, giant glowing cars forever? And that's your story?"
Phineas, And we're sticking to it...apparently.
Candace, Good! (at Linda) MOM! MOM! MOM! Heeheeheeheehee...
Linda, (has her head turned) Pie's on the table!
Candace, (With her eyes closed) Look! (Leans back on one of the cars)
Candace," (Falls backward as the car disintegrates) This is a car, mom! It just needs to...uh...uh...uh...see? (puts a clump of the Nano-bots in her hand) Vroom vroom! Okay. I'll admit, this does make me look a little bit...you know...crazy."
Linda, (Walks back inside to the kitchen) Who wants ice cream with that?
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, any second now something will explode on me and then we can go home. Yep, any second now."
Doofenshmirtz, Aaannny second.
Doofenshmirtz, Would you quit with the harmonica!?
