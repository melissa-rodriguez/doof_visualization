Phineas," (from inside) Okay, Ferb, let's get this early morning party started."
Reginald," Okay, prepare for landing. That's it, lad, don't let the turbulence throw you. Ha ha! Ha ha!"
Lawrence," Roger that, Papa Bear."
Reginald, I'm so glad we can still have our Father's Day jaunt in the biplanes.
Lawrence," Oh, yes, modern technology's wonderful. I know it's not quite the quite the same as..."
Phineas," (him and Ferb walk in the hallway) Hang on, Ferb."
Lawrence (cont'd), ...the real thing but I suppose it's better than nothing.
Phineas," Whoa, Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today. (walks in Lawrence's room) Surprise! Happy Father's Day, Dad. And you too, Grandpa Reg."
Reginald," Hello, boys."
Lawrence," Oh, how lovely. Breakfast in den."
Phineas, (reveals the Phineas and Ferb pancakes) Ferb and I pulled out all the stops.
Lawrence," What excellent likenesses! Ha ha ha! Thank you, boys."
Candace," Happy Father's Day, Dad."
Reginald," (on the computer) Hello, Candace."
Candace," (in Cockney accent) 'Ello, Grandpa Reg. (normal voice) Happy Father's Day."
Reginald," (on the computer) Thank you, love."
Linda," Hello, Reg. Are you having a ""Grand""-Father's Day? (laughs) Hoo hoo!"
Reginald, Ha ha ha! Good one!
Linda," I'll leave you boys to your Father's Day fun. Candace, are you ready to go?"
Candace," Sure, mom. Bye, grandpa."
Reginald," 'Ey, where's Perry?"
Major Monogram," Morning, Agent P. I see you're trying out the new SFU 2000. It's a lot of fun, but don't let your duties slide."
Carl," Agent P, what do you think of his Father's Day gift?"
Major Monogram," Yes, it's a lovely tie, but I'm not your father! (to Perry) Anyhoo, Doofenshmirtz has plans to gum up the entire Tri-State Area. And we need you to check it out. Good luck, Agent P."
Doofenshmirtz," Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! If you think this is a sticky situation, you better hold on to that fedora. Behold, the Gum-Under-The-Shoe-inator! I took all the wadded up chewing gum in the entire Tri-State Area and fed it into this -inator. Yeah, I know, it's really unsanitary. Why don't people just throw the chewing gum in the trash? Huh?"
Doofenshmirtz, (sighs) Today just isn't my day. It's Father's Day. It's the hardest of the greeting card company holidays for me. My issues with Father's Day began back when I was a child.
Doofenshmirtz, (voiceover) Those were lean times for my father and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed.
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, I know you've heard that one before, but...twice actually...but I really think that this is where my relationship with my father went awry."
Doofenshmirtz," (voiceover) I mean, he made me be that lawn gnome!"
Mr. Doofenshmirtz," Bewegen sie nicht! (""Don't move!"")"
Doofenshmirtz," I mean, he was really specific, too. He made me memorize the serial number of that particular lawn gnome. (While he talks, Perry goes onto the computer and opens the Lawn Gnome Tracker app.) DAEHM23. If only there was some way to reunite him with, y'know, that specific lawn gnome, maybe he and I could start again. (Looks at the computer.) DAEHM23?! You found him with an online gnome tracker? Wow, there really is an app for everything now, isn't there? Well, let's see. It says it's still in Drusselstein! Now I can heal the old wounds between my father and me! (gets up and walks but is stuck to the chair) Oh, man that is one of my most brilliant ideas yet! (His pointy nose pops the huge bubble made from the gum.)"
Phineas, An exact replica of Grandpa's old biplane! Dad's gonna love this! (He and Ferb climb in and put on their helmets and goggles.) Let's try 'er out! (The plane takes off.) Now punch it! (Ferb pushes a button on a remote control and four jet engines come out from the wings and the plane increases speed.) Yeah!
Doofenshmirtz, (offscreen) I know traveling by cannon is a little unconventional...
Doofenshmirtz (cont'd)," ...but the cannon place was going out of business, so I got them at a volume discount. (lights the fuse) Hang on. (The cannon fires.) Woohoo!"
Vanessa," Happy Father's Day, Dad! Dad?"
Doofenshmirtz," Sorry for the lack of inflight meals or entertainment, Perry the Platypus, but one cannon can only go so far, so I set up a worldwide network."
Doofenshmirtz, Aw man! Missed it by that much!
Phineas," Perfect landing, Ferb! I'll go get Dad. (Cut to the sliding door. Phineas leads his father out.) No peeking, Dad! Keep 'em closed! Okay, open 'em!"
Lawrence, (gasps)
Ferb, Tada!
Lawrence," (voice breaking in tears) Thank you so much, boys! I can't think of a better Father's Day gift!"
Phineas," Actually, there's a hidden feature you might wanna check out."
Reginald," (emerging from the passenger seat) 'Ello, son!"
Lawrence, D-Dad?! B-B-B-But...
Reginald, C'mon! Give us a hug!
Lawrence," (hugging his father) Oh, happy Father's Day!"
Reginald, What do you say we go on our traditional Father's Day flight?
Lawrence, Race you to the cockpit!
Phineas, Have fun!
Lawrence, What are you two standing there for? You're part of the tradition now! Come on!
Phineas, Cool!
Reginald, Right then! Engine...contact...
Lawrence, Here we go!
Lawrence, Wooooooooo!
Lawrence and Reg," ♪ In our two wing aeroplane, ♪"
Lawrence, ♪ I'm his son and he's me dad! ♪
Reg, ♪ And I look really grand in plaid ♪
Lawrence," Nice ad lib, Dad!"
Reg," Thanks, son, I just roll with it."
Lawrence and Reg, Like you do!
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, Drusselstein! This way, Perry the Platypus. (Doof and Perry get up and the cat meows. Cut to outside Ye Olde Pawn Shoppe.) Okay, so the gnome tracker located my father's long lost lawn gnome to this location. (He opens the door and gasps.) There it is! (He picks up a lawn gnome, but it talks.)"
Gnome," Hey, put me down!"
Doofenshmirtz, Ah! I thought you were my father's lawn gnome.
Gnome, No worries. I get that all the time. Probably due to my height combined with my eccentric fashion choices.
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, yeah. Huh. Well, I'm looking for DAEHM23."
Gnome," (picks up the real lawn gnome behind him) Oh, yeah, it's been here for years. Here you go."
Doofenshmirtz," It is you! My father will be so happy! Well, maybe not happy, but anything is an improvement over surly and dismissive. Let the father-son healing begin! (He arrives at the old Doofenshmirtz house and takes Perry out of the baby carrier.) Wish me luck, Perry the Platypus! (Perry smiles and gives him a thumbs-up.)"
Doofenshmirtz, (knocks and opens the door) Hello? Father? You're never going to guess what I brought y— (He trips on the floor mat and the gnome shatters to pieces.)
Doofenshmirtz's Dad," Oh, hello, Heinz."
Doofenshmirtz," (sadly) Hello, Father."
Doofenshmirtz's Dad," I see you've brought me assorted broken bits of pottery for Father's Day. Well, I suppose it's the thought that, um...counts. Your brother, Roger, remembered how much I loved that old lawn gnome, so he sent me this. (walks up to a giant lawn gnome) Look, it also makes espresso. (The gnome opens a compartment door and an espresso spout pours some into a mug, which Doofenshmirtz's dad takes out and sips.) Delicious. But, you know, rubble is...a nice gift, too."
Doofenshmirtz," (voice breaking in tears) Alright...um...Happy Father's Day. And...okay, bye-bye. (leaves)"
Doofenshmirtz's Dad, All zis way just to give me broken shards of potter— (gasps and sees the serial number) DAEHM23?!
Doofenshmirtz," (sighs) Well, that could've gone better. (Perry consoles him.) Why do I even bother, huh? At least there's one relationship in my life that's worked out pretty well. Thanks for coming along, Perry the Platypus. Let's go home. (They walk away from the curb.) You are my rock. (Cut to a cannon.) And by that, I mean you're there for me, you're not made out of rock. You're actually made out of...well, platypus, probably. (They climb into the cannon, which fires.)"
Lawrence," Well, that was the best Father's Day flight yet! It brought back some some wonderful old memories and created a lot of new ones. Thank you, boys, for making this possible!"
Phineas and Ferb, (hugging their father) Happy Father's Day!
Lawrence, Yes. Yes it is.
Reginald, Crikey! It's getting late! I best be on me way home. Mind if I borrow your new aeroplane?
Lawrence, Why don't you hang onto it 'til next year? I've got no room left in the garage anyway.
Reginald, Will do! Cheery-bye!
Linda," Hi, honey! Hi, boys! So how was your day?"
Lawrence," Oh, the boys and I spent a wonderful day flying with Father!"
Linda," Ah, the internet is a wonderful thing."
Lawrence," Well, yes, I...pfft...s'pose it is."
Linda," Well, here's something special from Candace and me."
Candace, (giving her father a gift box) Here you go!
Lawrence," (opening the box) Oh, my! An exact replica of Father's biplane! Oh, it's perfect! (giving his daughter a hug) Thank you so much, sweetheart!"
Candace," Happy Father's Day, Dad!"
